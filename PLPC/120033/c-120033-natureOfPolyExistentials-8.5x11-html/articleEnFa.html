<br>
</p><p>That which exists in nature in multiples, we call poly-existentials.
That which exists in nature in singular, we call
mono-existentials. 
All material objects exist in singular and are mono-existentials.
Ideas, information and knowledge exist in nature in multiples – not in
singular. Ideas, Information and knowledge are poly-existentials.
Much of our world is actually a mixture of mono-existentials and
poly-existentials, which we call mixed-existentials.</p><p>In this document we analyze the topic of <a id="hevea_default0"></a>Intellectual Property
(<a id="hevea_default1"></a>IP) from a new perspective.
The topic of monopolistic
ownership oriented restriction of poly-existentials and Western 
<a id="hevea_default2"></a>Intellectual Property Rights
(<a id="hevea_default3"></a>IPR)
are one and the same.
Yet, the concept and terminology of poly-existentials has not appeared in
prior discussions of this topic.
This is
the very first time that the concept and the word “poly-existentials”
are being introduced.</p><p>The traditional perspective on Intellectual Property is that, it
is debatable. Some good arguments have been made in its favor and
some good arguments have been made opposing it. Some are for it
and some are against it. It is perceived to be economically more
profitable to be for it, than to be against it. So, in the West, 
a whole lot more people are in its favor.</p><p>The model of poly-existence makes it easy to prove that the
concept of Intellectual Property is erroneous. This proof is
based on logic that is rooted in nature of existence and nature
of possession and the requirement for ownership to be in harmony
with nature of possession and existence. Unlike other writings on
this subject, we do not consider this as part of any debate. In
this document we prove that the basic concepts of Intellectual
Property are invalid.</p><p>The IPR regime is about extending the model and
concept of ownership of mono-existentials to the realm of
poly-existentials by creating artificial scarcity. This is against the
nature of poly-existence. </p><p>Ownership of poly-existentials impacts their manner-of-existence
towards being monopolistically controlled and towards becoming internally
opaque. Monopolistic oriented restriction of poly-existentials has
ramifications on autonomy and privacy of the individual and health of
societies. Natural dynamics of Western IP restrictions result in
reduced autonomy and privacy of the individual and result in transfer
of more power to corporations and Corpocracy. Any digital ecosystem that
is rooted in Western IPR puts humanity in danger. A moral alternative
to the American proprietary digital ecosystem (Internet as we know it
today) is called for.</p><p>The first part of this document is concerned with ontology of
poly-existentials. We construct the “Poly-Existentials Reference
Model” in order to analyze the nature of what IP restricts.
Poly-existentials are naturally un-scarce and naturally
multi-possessable and naturally un-territorial. Therefore
poly-existentials are unownable. Western IP regime is about
ownership (monopolistic restriction) of poly-existentials. The
concept of poly-existence through the poly-existentials reference
model makes the fraudulence of Western IPR regime clear and
obvious.</p><p>In the second part of this document, we engage in discrediting of the
IPR regime through debunking the arguments that have been put forward in
its support and we address the false beliefs surrounding Western
consensuses. We also put on the table the character of those who
originated it and who are pushing it. Westerners are vested in their
IPR regime. It is not in their interest to understand the invalidity
of IPR. We point out that when a given society gets its
fundamental ownership rules wrong, the consequences are severe. When
most of the world gets its fundamental ownership rules wrong, the
consequences are catastrophic.</p><p>The third part of this document is about solutions and cures. We
advocate full rejection of the Western IPR regime. We then
advance a specific replacement strategy which includes societal
and global governance models that require halaal
manner-of-existence of poly-existentials. We then propose
construction of a complete ethics oriented digital ecosystem
which has autonomy and privacy of the individual at its core. We
then introduce a starting point for such a digital ecosystem called:
<a href="http://www.by-star.net">The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem</a>.
Finally we postulate a set of societal strategies that in theory 
can cure Eastern societies and do an economic number on 
Western IPR vulnerabilities.</p><p>This document is vast in scope and in ambition. And, this
generally public version is just a beginning which should be
considered a draft. The first and second part are complete enough
to deserve scrutiny. The third part is incomplete but has enough
material to convey its intent and direction.
Throughout these three parts, our main goal is to underscore the 
importance of this topic and to agitate towards further discussions.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec3" The Nature Of Poly-Existentials Makes Them Unownable-->
<h2 id="sec3" class="section">1.1  The Nature Of Poly-Existentials Makes Them Unownable</h2><!--SEC END --><p>A thesis of this document is that poly-existentials are unownable.
Poly-existentials cannot be personal property.</p><p>Our analysis revolves around the relationships among:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Existence
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Possession
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Ownership
</li></ol><p>Existence and possession are aspects of nature, but ownership is a human
construct. Ownership, as man made rules, can in theory be anything.
In that sense, anything and everything is ownable. We then draw a
distinction between “proper ownership rules” and “improper
ownership rules”. We consider proper ownership rules as those which
are in harmony with existence and possession aspects of nature and
which result in enduring amelioration of society and humanity. An
acknowledged recent Western improper ownership rule is Americans’ 
ownership rules for Africans as slaves. Existence of humans as equals makes them
unownable. It is in this context that we consider poly-existentials
as ownable or unownable.</p><p>To a certain extent, each society’s ownership rules reflect that
society’s values and character. Intellectual Property as
ownership rules represents the American and Western model for
governance of poly-existentials. Since for Americans, IP is
directly sourced from the U.S. Constitution and since analysis of
ownership involves both the governed (poly-existentials) and the
governor, the American character is on the table. We therefore
need to fully consider it within our scope to analyze and
understand why these people (Americans) have come up with these
ownership rules (IP).</p><p>Ownership rules exisit to resolve conflicts and to improve order in society.
Main ownability requirements are the following:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Exclusive Possession – What is to be owned must be possessable
by only one possessor at any given time.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Scarcity – What is plentiful need not be owned.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Territoriality – Assignment of ownership in a given place should not impact 
other ownerships in other places. </li><li class="li-enumerate">Harmony with existence of the owned. </li></ol><p>The nature of poly-existentials violates these requirements:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Poly-existentials (e.g., ideas, formulas, knowledge) can be possessed
by multiple possessors at the same time.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Each poly-existential can easily be copied and can therefore be plentiful.
Each poly-existential is not scarce.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Each poly-existential can exist in multiple places at the sametime.
Each poly-existential can be possessed by multiple possessors in different places
at the same time. Poly-existentials are non-territorial.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">The concept of poly-existence (how the to be owned exists) as derived from nature
leads to their ownership being un-natural.
</li></ol><p>Poly-existentials are therfore unownable.</p><p>Western Intellectual Property Rights regime 
is an umbrella misnomer to cover the
following branches of US and Western laws:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
copyright
</li><li class="li-itemize">patent
</li><li class="li-itemize">trademark
</li></ul><p>Copyright, patent and trademark provide for ownership oriented
monopolistic restrictions of poly-existentials. Each of these branches
of Western law directly map to different forms of monopolistic
restriction and ownership of different aspects of certain types
of poly-existentials.</p><p>Since poly-existentials are unownable; copyright, patent and trademark
laws as individual branches of law and collectively as Intellectual
Property Rights regime are therefore invalid.</p><p>Ramifications of incorrect ownership laws can put societies and
humanity at risk.</p><p>The context of mono-existence is inherently local.
The context of poly-existence is inherently un-territorial, global and universal.</p>

values. Some of these concepts specifically reject American and Western values.
Western readers need to pay extra attention, as many of their
assumptions are likely not ours.</p><p>So-called Intellectual Property Rights (patent, copyright and trademark laws) are
fundamentally Western concepts. They are primarily rooted in the American, English,
French and European cultures. Much of our audience has
not had these beliefs and should not permit these corrupt beliefs to enter
their cultures. That segment of our audience that has patent and
copyright traditions in their culture and their belief system need to
recognize that these beliefs are by no means universal.</p>

IPR regime is a Western construct.
The concepts and vocabulary of IPR are Western and are targeted towards
justification, protections, promotion and propagation of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>The basis of analysis of this document is Eastern.
Many of the concepts that we use to invalidate Western IPR regime are
not rooted in Anglo-American<a id="hevea_default5"></a> English. Through out this document,
there are also a number of important words and concepts that we use in
their Globish sense and not in the Anglo-American<a id="hevea_default6"></a> English (Western)
sense.</p><p>The concepts behind these words, to a large extent, have directed our
analysis and as such are key to understanding this
document. Recognizing the specific contexts for our use of these
words is essential for understanding our exposition. Here we provide a
short list of some of the key words and concepts that are essential for 
our exposition.</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Libre:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
 Libre is a substitute for the word free in English which
distinguishes the freedom sense from the gratis sense. Libre in
Globish refers to the sense of freedom in the word “free”. The
other and dominant sense of the word free is gratis (free of
charge). In the context of this document our use of Libre is in the
scope of freedom from Western societal restrictions that come as a result of
IPR regime’s restrictions. This scoping of Libre is different from

To the degree that an individual masters his tools, he can invest
the world with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his
tools, the shape of the tool determines his own
self-image. Convivial tools are those which give each person who
uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with
the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this
possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to
determine the meaning and expectations of others.

When properly bounded, limited and controlled; there is nothing wrong
with a group of people creating a legal entity called a corporation
in order to generate economic profit for themselves.<p>But society faces grave risks of harm when corporations are not
properly bounded. Unbounded Corporations are a pillar of
Americanism. In that model, in due course humans become corporotized
economic creatures. The American/Western legal system then kicks in
and formalizes the Western legal notions of “corporate
personhood”. Americanism then amounts to a complete collection of
economic creatures (people and corporations alike) where money fully
rules and humanity is suppressed. </p><p>The scope of corporatization amongst Americanists is exceptional and
spans all aspects of life and all professions. In Americanism, even
academia, universities, medicine, medications, food, farming and
agriculture are to become or are to be left in the control of large
unbounded corporations.</p><p>By definition, corporations exist for the sole purpose of generating
profit. The character of such a “corporate personhood” is then
similar to that of a psychopath where empathy and remorse are
impaired and egotistical traits rule.</p><p>It is inside of Americanism that the Western IPR regime has
thrived. Copyright and patents have become instruments for
amplification of power of corporations and dominance of corporations
over individuals. After all is said and done, the overwhelming

have chosen intellectual property as a model for governance of

<h2 id="sec7" class="section">1.5  Our Motivations And Our Purposes<br>
 For Writing This Document</h2><!--SEC END --><p>We are software engineers. The Western IPR regime has crippled our
profession by prohibiting collaboration and transferring more power to
corporate businessmen. This has led to dominance of internally opaque
software and internally opaque internet services. 
Internally opaque
software and internally opaque internet services foster a competitive model 
which stifle engineering collaboration.
Internally opaque
software and internally opaque internet services in turn lead to deterioration of
individual’s autonomy and privacy.</p><p>Our profession, software and internet engineering, has a
responsibility to society and we have a responsibility to our
profession. It is towards fulfillment of our responsibilities to our
profession and our profession’s responsibility to society and humanity
that we have prepared this document.</p><p>Because we have been close to writing of software and creation of internet services,
we understand the ramifications of the Western IPR regime better than many others.
Dynamics of the Western IPR regime are such that they put society and humanity at risk.</p><p>We have concluded that the Western IPR regime is a colossal mistake.</p><p>Let’s say that based on solid logic we could demonstrate that
the bases for establishment of IPR regime is fundamentally wrong and
that IPR regime results in serious harm to society and humanity.
What impact would that have?
Contemporary global mistakes often result in entrenched vested interests. 
Many powerful people and entities are deeply vested in Western IPR.
Such deep
economic interests often prevent people’s willingness to hear and follow basic logic.</p><p>The Western IPR regime is a sphere of consensus that can not be changed
based on logic and reason alone.
Therefore, the scope and purpose of this document can not be limited to
logic and reason alone.</p><p>The consequences of the IPR Western ownership mistake are even more
grave than the previous Western ownership mistake – that of slavery
of Africans by Americans based on formal Western laws of ownership of
human beings. This time ramifications of the mistake are broader than
just America or the West, they put all of humanity in danger.</p><p>Ramifications and harm of the Western IPR regime are far broader than
they are generally understood. Western IPR regime indirectly impacts the 
individual’s autonomy and privacy and distorts the relationship between 
individuals and corporation.</p><p>In this document we address much of what surrounds IPR. Our goal is
to open the subject wide towards tangible results.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">We introduce the concept of poly-existentials and based on that
we evaluate the validity of the Western IPR regime based on logic.
Based on that analysis we conclude that all basis for establishment

clear that the Western IPR regime should be abolished. But
abolishment of IPR regime should not lead to ungoverned
poly-existence. Poly-existentials should be regarded as “public
goods” and as such deserve legal protection because of negative
externalities which arise if poly-existentials are not properly
governed.<p>We frame the question of correct governance of
poly-existentials in their halaal and haraam manner-of-existence.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">We then recognize digital as the most potent form of

style. The parts that introduce the concept and terminology of nature
of poly-existentials are scholarly, formal, logic based, and persuasion
oriented.</p><p>The parts that deal with exposure of the Western IPR regime
mistake are by choice inflammatory and aggressive. Our
philosophical analysis is that nature of poly-existentials leads
to the natural right to copy and the natural right to apply
knowledge without any monopoly oriented restrictions. This in
turn naturally leads to full rejection of the restrictive IPR
regime. The context of poly-existentials is inherently
universal. It is the responsibility of those who wish to
restrict our (humans) natural rights, to make a case for their
model. The burden of proof is on them not on us.</p><p>A meaningful case for IPR has never been made. So,
where appropriate we mock and we ridicule the Western status quo. We
frequently toy with the self-absorption and overly individualistic
aspects of Western cultures. Logic and persuasion alone are
ineffective against the entrenched Western IPR disease. Exposure of
the Western IPR regime mistake also involves the clarification that
IPR is a Western and mostly American mistake. As such our tone may
come across as anti-American and anti-Western. Western readers need to
recognize that the intended audience of this document is all of
humanity and that the scope of this topic is all of humanity. The
nature of this topic is inherently global.</p><p>The purpose and scope of this document is not limited to analysis of
Western IPR disease. We also offer theoretical recipes for cures.
The parts of this document that
deal with the cure, occasionally go beyond persuasion and are
prophetic. The cure part is broken into Western cures and Eastern
cures – each with their own flavor.</p><p>Content of this document reflects our independent thoughts. We
have not received any funding for producing this document.
We have not written this
document in the traditional context of Western IPR where the
result of our work are expected to bring economic rewards.
We have something to say and we want
others to read it and discuss it – towards the progress of
science and useful arts. Verbatim copying of this
poly-existential is unrestricted. We believe that the
collaborative model is the one which motivates real engineers,
real scientists and real artists.</p><p>We are law abiding citizens. We underscore the corrupt nature of
Western IPR regime, but we do not advocate illegal or
unauthorized copying in applicable territory. We advocate the
abolishment of Western IPR regime. In the mean time, we
encourage authors and inventors to subject their work to
non-restrictive copyright and no patents or non-restrictive
(defensive) patents in applicable territories. We advocate full
rejection of the Western IPR regime in territories where they may
be under consideration.</p><p>
The anti-Americanist<a id="hevea_default29"></a> tone and our focus on
curing Eastern societies is not towards a market oriented
agenda. It is reality and logic that has taken us there. In

and the governor (economic creatures vs humans) need to be subjects of
our analysis. In the context of governorship, 
throughout this document, in parallel with the model of poly-existence,
we draw a clear and explicit distinction between being an economic
creature and being a human. </p><p>In a sense then, you are part of the governorship. Governance of
poly-existentials by humans for humanity would be distinct and
different from governance of poly-existentials by economic creatures
for economic creatures. We have a choice. Ownership is a human construct.
We are in charge.</p><p>Americanism as a model for self-toxicated economic creature existing
in an industrial context has led to the creation of the artificial
competition oriented Western Intellectual Property Rights regime.
Humanism as a model for humans living in societies leads to the

production, organization and propagation of poly-existentials.
Professions related to: software, engineering, teaching, research,
arts, journalism, medicine, pharmacy, plant biology, etc. – all
involve production or propagation of poly-existentials. As a
medical doctor, when you prescribe patented medications, you are
propagating patents. As a software engineer working for the likes of
Microsoft, when you write code, you are producing copyrighted
material. Today, large parts of many societies are intellectual workers.
Enlarging of numbers of intellectual workers throughout the world is a 
clear trend.</p><p>It is very convenient for intelectuall workers to assume the validity
of IP and become accomplices. Status quo is often very profitable for
intelectuall workers. It may well not be in your economic interest to

</p><p>Here we categorize our world into two:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Mono-Existentials
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Poly-Existentials
</li></ol><p>There are things in nature that exist in singular and there are 
things that exist in multiples.</p><p>That which exists in nature in singular, we call
mono-existential. Examples of mono-existentials include:
tangible physical objects, a pencil, land, Internet domain
names, bandwidth. Chemistry and physics are the realm of mono-existentials.</p><p>That which exists in nature in multiples, we call
poly-existential. Examples of poly-existentials include:
knowledge, ideas, information, the digital entities.</p><p>This natural categorization then permits us to revisit the
question of ownership of poly-existentials which simply maps to
the Western Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Regime. The topics
of Western IPR and ownership and restriction of poly-existentials
are one and the same.</p><p>Our analysis is from the perspective of the possessed.
Traditional Western IPR analysis has always been from the
perspective of owner/creator/author.
The perspective of the possessed represents societal and human liberties.</p><p>This is the first introduction of the concept of
poly-existentials which leads to a different way of looking and
analyzing Western IPR regime. This duality of analysis based on
the perspective of author/owner vs. the perspective of
possessor/owned perspectives is similar to time domain analysis
vs frequency domain analysis or the dual nature of light as
particle or light as wave. They are different bases of analysis
for the same thing. Results of correct analysis in each domain
are equally valid and incorrect analysis in each domain are
equally invalid.</p><p>There is ample historic precedence for our approach. In the 13th
century Ibn-Sina<a id="hevea_default35"></a> «بو علی سینا» produced
“Daneshnamh Alaei” «دانشنامه علایی»,
[<a href="#daneshnameh">30</a>], in which he classified his world. Based on
that classifications, he then used logic to conclude. Ibn-Sina<a id="hevea_default36"></a>’s
work became a basis for much of the Western scholarly
beginnings. In a sense, what we are doing here is extension of
that type of classification and logic for the digital era.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec16" Poly-Existentials Reference Model-->
<h2 id="sec16" class="section">2.1  Poly-Existentials Reference Model</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In this chapter we begin to develope a reference model. Let’s
call it the “Poly-Existentials Reference Model”. Our goal is
to introduce a set of concepts and a terminology that can then be
used to evaluate merits of Western Intellectual Property laws and
to assist us to understand the proper governance model that is
needed for poly-existentials. The poly-existentials reference
model is independent and outside of the Western IP traditions.
This reference model is based on nature. It reflects science, not
beliefs, faith and opinions. This model is independent of
societal consensus and is equally valid in the East and the West.</p><p>We then put the Western IPR model against the poly-existentials
reference model and see that the two are in conflict. When
nature and man made conventions conflict, it is the man made
conventions that are wrong. The poly-existentials reference model
permit us to <span style="font-weight:bold">prove</span> that Western copyright and patent laws are
invalid as any form of property. Such a proof is then no longer
subject to any dispute because it is rooted in nature and logic
– not beliefs and opinions.</p><p>We then conclude that the Western
IPR model is erroneous. Based on that, we advocate that the
Western IPR model should be abolished.</p><p>Such analysis needs to start with clear categorization of
mono-existentials, poly-existentials and mixed-existentials.</p>

mixed-existentials, the dominant aspect of poly-existence or
mono-existence is sometimes clear. In such instances, we will refer to

are mono-existentials. 
But the content of the book (its information)
is poly-existential. 
In the case of a book, clearly the dominant
aspect is usually (not always) poly-existential. When you read a
book, you are reading its content.
A book can easily be digitized, in which case it
becomes a pure poly-existential.

dominant aspect could have been its mono-existential dimension.</p><p>In the case of a given factory generated spoon,
the dominant aspect is usually the material spoon which is
mono-existential and not poly-existential instructions supplied to the

(e.g. Wikipedia and Jewish<a id="hevea_default40"></a> IPR analysis make that mistake).</p><p>Introduction of the concept of poly-existentials fully eliminates this
common confusion.</p><p>The concept of poly-existentials is a philosophical concept. The
concept of Non-Rivalry<a id="hevea_default41"></a> Goods is an economic term. Basing economics as
the primary basis for structuring human laws is wrong. Inclusion of
IPR in the US constitution by businessmen (so-called founding fathers
of America) is another example of the confusion which amounts to an
attempt in creating rivalry goods from poly-existentials – based on artificial scarcity.</p><p>Goods that are both non-rival and non-excludable are called “public
goods.” It is generally accepted by mainstream economists that the
market mechanism will under-provide public goods, so these goods have
to be produced by other means, including government provision.
Poly-existentials are inherently public goods.</p><p>The Western IPR regime is the opposite of “Public Goods”. In the US
constitution we have government provisions creating artificial
scarcity against the public good.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec29" Poly-Existentials-->
<h2 id="sec29" class="section">2.4  Poly-Existentials</h2><!--SEC END --><p>We present the concept of “Expressed Formula” as the general form of “primary
poly-existential”. The digital format presents a “pure poly-existential” form.
Unless expresses a formula is not a poly-existential. </p><p>Full emergence of digital technology in the middle of 20th century, 
has moved humanity
into an arena where the dominance of mono-existentials ended. We now live is a world where
poly-existentials impact nearly every aspect of life. Restrictions on poly-existentials
has been harming nearly every aspect of life.</p><p>Pure poly-existentials are kept in some form of memory. 
poly-existentials are “remembered”, “retrieved” with memory.
Memory relates to object permanence. 
While memory is usually material poly-existentials are always 
non-material.
Memory
can be human’s brain or hand written ink on a piece of paper,
machine produced ink on paper (traditional books), digitized
information on hard disk. The general form memory can functions
as a minimal substrate and be the container of poly-existentials.</p><p>An animal can be
the producer of the poly-existential and an animal’s memory
can be the memory for a poly-existential.
But, poly-existentials are for the most part result of human activity.
Poly-existentials are often expected to be useful. The value of the
poly-existentials come from the impact that they can have on
human condition.</p><p>Poly-existentials can be re-instantiated. two copy of the Expressed Formula
are two instances of the same formula.
The mechanism that surround storage of the pure poly-existentials
(e.g.; brain (human’s or animal’s), paper, digital memory) can
facilitate copying, transmission and dissemination of the pure
poly-existentials to varying degrees. The digital form in particular
makes copying, transmission and dissemination of pure poly-existential
extremely practical and as such the digital era has made understanding
the nature of poly-existentials most critical.</p><p>Unlike mono-existentials, poly-existentials are not bound by
location. At any given time multiple instances of the same
poly-existential could be in different places. Unlike
mono-existentials, poly-existentials can be transmitted or
broadcasted over distances at the maximum theoretical speed of
light. The digital form of poly-existentials permits for
error-free and exact transmission and error-free and exact
copying of poly-existentials. This ability to make exact
transmission and exact copying of poly-existentials is a new
human capability that occured in 20th centure. It is this new
capability that has made the need for a poly-existential
reference model more acute.</p><p>Expressed Formula is either for human consumption (idea, knowledge,
software source code) or for machine consumption (binary software,
paper tape for NC machines, Music CDs).</p><p>Propagation, replication, copying of poly-existentials is as simple as
memory transfer. Restricting propagation of
poly-existentials is counter to nature.
New existence (instantiations) of poly-existentials have no impact on 
previous existence.
Additional existence of poly-existentials can make them 
more useful. 
Monopolistic ownership oriented restriction of
poly-existentials is counter to nature and creates harmful artificial
scarcities.
Monopolistic ownership oriented restriction of poly-existentials is morally wrong and should be
abolished.
Attribution of Expressed Formula to its producer is called
for. </p><p>For mono-existentials
possession and ownership is one-to-one. 
For poly-existentials.
possession is many-to-many and therfore ownership is not possible.</p>

poly-existentials can not be owned. Western IP laws are about
assigning ownership to multi-possessables (poly-existentials), as
such Western IP laws are erroneous laws. They are erroneous
because multiple possessions of a poly-existential does not lead
to conflict and because they are counter to the nature of

liberty. Ownership of a mono-existential restricts actions of

mono-existential (a unique instance). Ownership of a

of a mixed-existential put blanket restrictions on liberty of all
those who wish to interact with any instance (all instances) of

Natural scarcity is that which follows from the relationship

to conceive of it before any human, institutional, contractual
arrangement. Artificial scarcity, on the other hand, is the
outcome of such arrangements. Artificial scarcity can hardly
serve as a justification for the legal framework that causes that
scarcity. Such an argument would be completely circular. On the

copying and partial copying of many types of poly-existentials
including, books and code (software).</p><p>Copyright believers claim that
one of the most visible rights that the author of a work has, is the
copyright over his work. Almost everything that is published, whether
eletronically or not, is copyrighted. In general, a work is
copyrighted when it is created, and it is not necessary to apply for
copyright. Some countries may, however, give extra protection to works
that are registered. In any case, when a work is copyrighted, others
may not use or redistribute the work without the permission of the
author.</p><p>Copyrights are considered "territorial rights", which means that
they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific
jurisdiction. While many aspects of national copyright laws have
been standardized through international copyright agreements,
copyright laws vary by country.</p><p>In the U.S.A., copyright is a right given to authors of “original
works,” such as books, articles, movies, and computer
programs. Copyright gives the exclusive right to reproduce the
work, prepare derivative works, or to perform or present the work
publicly. Copyrights protect only the form or expression of
ideas, not the underlying ideas themselves. While a copyright
may be registered to obtain legal advantages, a copyright need
not be registered to exist. Rather, a copyright comes into
existence automatically the moment the work is “fixed” in a
“tangible medium of expression,” and lasts for the life of the
author plus seventy years, or for a total of ninety-five years in
cases in which the employer owns the copyright.</p>

the inventor a limited monopoly on the manufacture, use,

patentable. Three categories of subject matter that are
unpatentable are: “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and
abstract ideas.” Reducing abstract ideas to some type of
“practical application,” i.e., “a useful, concrete and tangible
result,” is patentable, however. U.S. patents, last from the

patents should be available in WTO member states for any
invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new,

patentable subject matter from country to country, even among WTO
member states. TRIPS also provides that the term of protection

a burger. Under current law, Rothbard, the “owner” of the
RothbardBurgers trademark, can prevent the Lachmannian from using
the mark RothbardBurgers to sell burgers because it is
“confusingly similar” to his own trademark. That is, it is likely
to mislead consumers as to the true source of the goods
purchased. The law, then, gives a right to the trademark holder
against the trademark infringer. <p>In my view, it is the consumers
whose rights are violated, not the trademark holder’s. In the

Lachmannian for fraud and breach of contract (not to mention
intentional infliction of emotional distress and
misrepresentation of praxeological truths). However, it is
difficult to see how this act of fraud, perpetrated by the
Lachmannian on me, violates Rothbard’s rights. The Lachmannian’s
actions do not physically invade Rothbard’s property. He does
not even convince others to do this; at most, he may be said to
convince third parties to take an action within their rights,

Rothbard.

</p><p>The poly-existential reference model that we presented in 
this section makes it clear that:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
The subject of patent, copyright and trademark are poly-existentials.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Poly-existentials are multi-possessable and therefore unownable.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Poly-existentials are inherently non-scarce and therefore unownable.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Poly-existentials are inherently not-territorial and therefore unownable.
</li></ol><p>Mono-possession and scarcity are fundamental requirements for
property and ownership.
The underlying subjects of patent, copyright and trademark are
poly-existentials. That which is to be patented, copyrighted and
trademarked are unownable and therefore can not be considered
property of any sort.</p><p>Ownership of poly-existentials in the form of monopolized
restriction of poly-existentials and their consideration as any
from of property is erroneous and counter to nature.</p><p>Therefore, patent, copyright and trademark individually and under
the collective label of Intellectual Property are fraudulent. The
fraud is that of applying property and ownership to
poly-existentials which are inherently not ownable.</p><p>Having established that patent, copyright and trademark are not
any form of property, we now consider them as societal regulations.</p><p>Patent, copyright and trademark in general and patent and
copyright in particular are local laws that result in grants of
monopoly privileges for restriction of poly-existentials.</p><p>These restrictions result in scarcity of poly-existentials which
are otherwise inherently non-scarce. Patent, copyright and
trademark are local laws that result in creation of artificial
scarcity.</p><p>The purpose of patent and copyright laws in creating artificial
scarcity is towards the goal of “promoting the progress of
science and useful arts” by providing exclusive rights to
creators. This amounts to the assumption that by making a
particular useful poly-existential scarce it is possible to
create an unnatural environment that is superior for creation of
more useful poly-existentials. This in turn is based on the
assumption that a forced competitive model is superior to the
natural collaborative model for progressing science and useful
arts. Both of these assumptions were unproven at the time that
patent and copyright laws were instituted. We now know that both
of these assumptions are wrong.</p><p>It is impossible to “prove” a negative – that IP does not have
the direct positive economic and innovative effect often claimed.
But there is also no conclusive evidence that Western patent and
copyright laws have had the direct economic effect often claimed.
There is also no conclusive evidence that patent and copyright
laws increase incentives for innovation. There are many
indications that patent and copyright laws hamper innovation.</p>

<a id="sec:RamificationsOfTheWesternIPRFraud"></a>
</p><p>After more than 200 years of being in practice in the West, there
is no empirical evidence that confirm success of Western IPR in
accomplishing its intended goal. However, the harm of Western IPR
in the form of restricting natural rights of others is concrete
and evident.</p><p>Patent and copyright laws are hostile to liberty. Patent and
copyright monopolies interfere with the freedom of others. They
prevent others to use their own knowledge, their own bodies and
their own justly acquired mono-existential properties as they
relate to the specific poly-existentials that patent and
copyright restrict. Secondary effects of patent and copyright laws
result in reduction of autonomy and privacy of individuals.</p><p>Grants of patent and copyright monopoly in the wealth
maximization utilitarian model end up damaging market
foundations. Creation of artificial scarcity for
poly-existentials towards mimicking the market process governing
mono-existentials results in weakening ownership of
mono-existentials. The very same legal foundation from which
markets begin.</p><p>Patent and copyright laws are in conflict with nature, They do
not serve the ideal intended purpose of societal regulations,
i.e. to balance rights equitably among conflicting
constituencies. On the contrary, it has the effect of enriching a
minority of powerful vested interests, to the very great
detriment of society at large. The detrimental effects include
the obstruction of engineering creativity, a distortion of the
competitive business environment, and denial of the benefits
thereof to the public.</p><p>In practice, natural dynamics of Western IP restrictions result in
transfer of power and autonomy away from individuals and to
corporations and Corpocracy.</p><p>Patent and copyright are laws that have severe harmful
ramifications which are not generally understood. In the context
of software and internet (digitals – pure poly-existentials),
Western patent and copyright laws have directed
manner-of-existence of software and internet services to become
internally opaque. As a result we don’t usually know what the
software or internet service that we are using is doing. This in
turn has been eroding our autonomy and privacy. And that trend is
continuing.</p><p>The natural global and universal nature of poly-existentials has
required the Western IPR regime pushers to present patent and
copyright laws as universal and global. In other words a local
ownership mistake is well on its way to becoming a global
ownership mistake.</p><p>The Western so-called Intelectual Propoerty Rights regime has put

such deserve legal protection because of negative externalities
which arise if poly-existentials are not properly governed.</p><p>One of our challenges here is that of terminology. The concepts
of “public goods”, “commons”, “targedy of the commons”, etc
are all rooted in the realm of mono-existentials but have
occasionally been extended to poly-existentials without the
needed recognitions. Hence, use of the existing terminology for
analysis of proper governance of poly-existentials 
rapidly becomes disorderly.</p><p>The types of needed legal protections are dependent on the type
of poly-existentials and are to be rooted in the health of
professions that correspond to the poly-existential. All of this
is to be towards health of society and humanity.</p><p>The most basic needed legal protections of poly-existentials is
for their manner-of-existence. Because manner-of-existence of
poly-existentials is inherently universal and global, it is this
most basic aspect of poly-existentials that should eventually be
subjected to global governance (legal protections).</p><p>Hence, we set the stage for moving towards global definitions and

</blockquote><p>we introduce the term "Convivial" into Globish.</p><p>Briefly, in Illich’s words:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates
himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he
actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon.<p>To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world
with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools,
the shape of the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial
tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest
opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or
her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who
use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning
and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a
convivial fashion.
</p></blockquote><p>The dynamics of the Western IPR regime are such
that they produce industrial tools.</p><p>In a sense, tools are extension of human behavior.</p><p>Conviviality of tools involves their manner-of-existence, capabilities
of the tools, their broader environment and their usage context.
The dimension of manner-of-existence of poly-existential tools (their
Libre-Halaalness) is necessary but not sufficient to make the tools 
convivial.</p><p>In the context of our own profession (software and internet
engineering), we build on this and provide definitional criteria
for Libre-Halaal Software and Libre-Halaal Internet Services.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec79" Ramifications Of Manner-Of-Existence Of Poly-Existentials On Professions-->
<h2 id="sec79" class="section">4.3  Ramifications Of Manner-Of-Existence Of Poly-Existentials On Professions</h2><!--SEC END --><p>We put our finger on Western IPR Regime and label it a central sin of our time because
it impacts many professions and many aspects of life. Western IPR regime is the source of
much that becomes haraam.</p><p>Each profession has a responsibility to society and humanity towards
protecting a certain aspect of life. In order to fulfill these
responsibilities, professions need and require certain moral
understandings and agreements from society.</p><p>Here we are using the term “profession” in the way it is understood in the East.</p><p>The notion of a “profession” in the West consists of training and the acquisition of
specialized skills, to perform specialized work, to create monetary income. The
responsibility of a profession towards society at large does not factor significantly in
this. Western society is mostly, if not totally, economically driven. The Western model of
economically driven individuals existing within an industrial context considers only money
and self-interest. Such broader concepts as society, profession, responsibility and
respect are very weak in the Western model.</p><p>In the East the word “profession” carries a greater meaning. It
includes the Western meaning of a specialized skill set to perform
work of value to others. But it also includes an agenda of trust and
responsibility. The professional person is entrusted by society to
maintain guardianship over an important aspect of life. Based on
proper execution of this responsibility, the profession is respected.</p><p>The primary author of this essay, attests that:
for him as an engineer it is only in Iran that he is called “Mr. Engineer Banan<a id="hevea_default52"></a>.” That has
never happened to him in America, Canada, England, France, or anywhere else in his travels
throughout the Western world.</p><p>So it is in this Eastern sense that we are here speaking of “professional
responsibility.”</p><p>Today, professions know less borders. And these certain moral understandings need to now
be certain global moral understandings and agreements from humanity. Such global moral
agreements can well take the form of halaal and haraam declarations.</p><p>Subject-matter knowledge and application of subject-matter knowledge is at the core of
professions. The profession’s subject-matter knowledge is often tied to something that is
a basic societal need. Farmers and Food, Doctors and Medication, Software-Engineers and
Software are some examples. Restriction of knowledge and restriction of application of
knowledge through patents amounts to crippling of professions. That crippling of
professions in turn makes the manner-of-existence of the thing that the profession is
responsible for, a haraam manner-of-existence.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec80" Role of Professions in Declaring Halaal and Haraam-->
<h3 id="sec80" class="subsection">4.3.1  Role of Professions in Declaring Halaal and Haraam</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The rapid pace of technology has created an environment where the need for halaal/haraam
declarations is more urgent.</p><p>Because the profession is often closest to the source of the harm and because the
profession is sometimes best positioned to understand the harm, the profession should
sometimes blow the whistle before the ethicists, theologians, philosophers, sociologists and
legislators get to it.
Often, by the time that the legislators get to it, it is too late.</p><p>The halaal manner-of-existence of
what is at the base and core of a profession therefore needs protection. For example:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Halaal Manner Of Existence Of Medication</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> is fundamental to the profession of Medicine.

</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Halaal Manner Of Existence Of Digitals</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> is fundamental to the profession of Software Engineering.
</dd></dl><p>Here we briefly consider, “Medicine and Doctors”, “Food and Farmers” 
and “Knowledge and Academics”
as three
examples. We then focus on our own profession (Software Engineering) to 
move towards defining halaal-manner-of-existence of software.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec81" Medication and Doctors-->
<h4 id="sec81" class="subsubsection">Medication and Doctors</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The fact that patented medication in the West restricts healing has ramifications for the
profession of medicine in Brazil, in Iran, in China and everywhere. In the Western patent
model, the knowledge of the cure for an illness is at hand, but applying that knowledge to
produce the medication is restricted by the patent regime and the businessman who holds
that patent (a monopoly). And the patient has to suffer and perhaps die, unless he is rich
enough and he conforms to the Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights economic
regime that demands payment to the patent holder who is in control of his cure. In many
cases, the cost of a patented medication is almost entirely the cost of the patent. The
cost of the ingredients and the cost of making the drug are often a very small fraction of
what the patent holder demands for the patent.</p><p>In America, the profession of medicine has fully failed society. The American doctor has
become quite comfortable being an economic creature existing in an industrial context. The
“Patient” has become the “Client”. The American “Doctor” has become the “Service
Provider”. And in that “Client”–”Provider” model, the services and goods being
exchanged for money is called “Health Care”. In that model, of course there is no place
for respect that Society owes its Doctors.</p><p>The nature of the profession of medicine is unique and making it be subservient to the
economic model damages society and endangers humanity. In America the profession of
medicine is fully subservient to economics. This is fully manifest in an exceptionally
American phenomena: Prescription Drug Advertising. On national TV, the holder of patents
for prescription drugs directly advertises to the public the availability of their goods.
The business-man dangles the cure in front of the patient and tells the
customer to demand that good from his service provider. That much for the end of the
Doctor-Patient relationship! The ugliness of this inhumanity goes straight over the heads
of American individualistic economic creatures.</p><p>The profession of medicine and Doctors everywhere should do what the American service
provider does not comprehend: start with demanding that society, government and moral
leaders declare:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
Patents for Medications are Haraam.
</blockquote><p>It is only after the powerful patent based pharmaceutical industry is contained, that 
Medicine may have a chance to be a profession.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec82" Food and Farmers-->
<h4 id="sec82" class="subsubsection">Food and Farmers</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The fact that American agro-business has terminated the American farmer (see Food Inc<a id="hevea_default53"></a>., [<a href="#FoodInc">25</a>].)
has ramifications for the Brazilian, Iranian and Chinese farmers. A main instrument of
American agro-business in terminating the American farmer were patented chemicals and
patented organisms. Separate from the American economic model, Brazilian, Iranian and
Chinese farmers should put on the table the question of what makes for global halaal
agriculture and what makes for global halaal food. Are patented GMOs (Genetically Modified
Organisms) haraam? Is patented food haraam?</p><p>Farmers everywhere should do what the American farmer
failed to do: demand that society, government and moral
leaders declare:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
Patents for Food are Haraam.
</blockquote>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec83" Knowledge And Academics-->
<h4 id="sec83" class="subsubsection">Knowledge And Academics</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Academics play an important role in the well being of the society. Their role falls into
two broad categories:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Teaching – dissemination of knowledge
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Research – discovery and production of knowledge
</li></ol><p>Teaching prospers when copying is not restricted by the Western copyright regime.</p><p>Research prospers when application of knowledge is not restricted by the Western patent
regime.</p><p>The existence of the patent and copyright debate may be understandable in the industry but not in academia.
Pursuit of knowledge is in conflict with ownership of knowledge.
Being in favor of patents and participating in IPR regime is in conflict with being an academic. </p><p>Yet, American Academia loves copyright and patents. There is no shortage of so-called
American teachers that compete in producing copyright restricted text books and lecture
notes. There is no shortage of so-called American researchers that keeps restricting
application of knowledge with patents.</p><p>The process that has made the American economic model the American societal model has corrupted both teaching and research. </p><p>Academics everywhere should do what the American academic has
failed to do: demand that society, government and moral
leaders declare:

demonstrating the erroneous fundamentals of Western intellectual property rights regime.
Software is of essential use. Software is purely digital. Under the halaal manner of

The Proprietary Software Model.<p>This model is exemplified by Microsoft Windows. It is based on a
competitive development model, and dominated by American
companies. It is protected and rooted in the corrupt Western
so-called Intellectual Property Rights regime, in particular the
twin ownership mechanisms of patent and copyright. It is opaque
and prevents software users from knowing what their software is doing.
Therefore, the user can not trust the software.
Its distribution is controlled by its producer.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">The Non-Proprietary Software Model.<p>This model is exemplified by Debian GNU/Linux. It is based on a
collaborative development model where software engineers worldwide
work collectively to move the software forward. It rejects the
corrupt Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights regime of
patent and copyright. It is internally transparent and permits
the Software Engineering profession to verify the software.
Therefore, the user can trust the software.
Its distribution is unrestricted.</p></li></ol><p>Though it is not part of popular cultural awareness, there is
currently a titanic battle taking place between these two competing
ideologies.
This is a to-the-death battle,
from which there can eventually emerge only a single winner.</p><p>The software battle is part of a broader ideological contest, about
ownership models for
<a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120033">poly-existentials in
general</a> (software, but also including literature, music, images,
movies, etc.) in the digital era.</p><p>The result of this battle has broader
ramifications for individuals and society – which impact autonomy,
privacy, freedom, and social interaction.
The model that any given society chooses for the manner-of-existence of software (and more
broadly digital constructs and poly-existentials) impacts social and societal behaviors
and shapes what people become.</p><p>The scope of usage of the “Libre-Halaal” label is the entirety of the domain of
poly-existentials. The digital domain as a form of poly-existentials is of particular
interest to us as software engineers.</p><p>Libre-Halaal Software in particular is of importance in that software is controller of all
that is digital. Key attributes of Libre-Halaal Software are that its usage and copying
are unrestricted and it is perpetually internally transparent and modifiable.</p><p>We want to move towards defining the halaal manner-of-existence of Software and the halaal
manner-of-existence of Internet Services and halaal manner-of-existence of Digital
Ecosystems. As such we provide our definitions for use of the labels Libre-Halaal for
Software, Internet Services and Digital Ecosystems in [<a href="#PLPC-120041">5</a>].</p><p>The Free Software<a id="hevea_default59"></a> and Open Source movements and their combination the Free and open-source
software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) have been attempting to
address this labeling challenge. Because their philosophical and moral analysis is
shallow, all of their labels are problematic in a number of respects.</p><p>The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of IPR regime being just Western and does not
call for full abolishment of the IPR regime. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of the place of
software as a special form of digital poly-existential. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep
recognition of importance of morality and role of software engineering profession in
formulation of definitions and labels.</p><p>But since we have the “Libre” label in common, we use the “Libre-Halaal” label when
operating in Western authority. Where our rejection of the copyright regime is through
FLOSS copyleft licensing. And where we wish to express common cause with our FLOSS brothers and
sisters.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec88" Software and Internet Services as Natural Primary Focus-->
<h3 id="sec88" class="subsection">4.6.1  Software and Internet Services as Natural Primary Focus</h3><!--SEC END --><p>We are software engineers.
Our profession, the Software Engineering profession, is hindered by the Western so-called
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime. As engineers instead of being able to freely
collaborate, we are enticed to compete. Instead of collectively inventing and innovating
towards the good of society, the Western IPR model pushes us to individually reinvent.</p><p>Software and Internet Services have become an integral and critical component of societal
functioning, and the consequences for humanity are enormous. Of fundamental importance in
this regard is what we will call the <em>manner of existence</em> of software.</p><p>We present the Halaal <em>manner of existence</em> of software and Internet services in:

. 
The Western IPR regime adversely impacts our ability to produce Libre-Halaal software and Internet services.</p><p>It is for this reason that we are writing this paper. While poly-existentials are far
broader than software, we emphasis software in this presentation for two reasons. First,
we are software engineers. Second, the collaborative and cumulative and usage orientation
of software (as a poly-existential) permits us to demonstrate the natural power of
poly-existentials in contrast to Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
regime. This of course is demonstrated in success of the Libre-Halaal GNU/Linux in contrast to
the proprietary MS Windows.</p>

right and wrong can be reached based on logic, they are absolute.
Such rights and wrongs are not a matter of
opinion, personal, societal or global beliefs.</p><p>It is not unusual for global beliefs to be wrong and counter to basic
logic. By “global beliefs” or “societal beliefs” we mean spheres
of consensus that are global or societal in scope. People are often
born into such wrong global/societal beliefs and ordinary people are
often unable to follow correct basic logic when they have been
brainwashed from birth.</p><p>In due course some unrecognized societal mistakes can be recognized and understood. When
looked at in historic terms, they become obvious.</p><p>Such historic global and societal mistakes include:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Earth is center of universe
</li><li class="li-itemize">Earth is flat
</li><li class="li-itemize">American ownership rules for African humans
</li></ul><p>But when we are in the middle of contemporary societal global mistakes, clear vision
is often hard to come by.
So, there are some global and societal mistakes that remain unrecognized by masses
and societies. </p><p>Unrecognized global mistakes in due course become faith.</p><p>As Hellman puts it:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Faith-based reasoning led the Inquisition to hold fast to a
complex and convoluted Ptolemaic model of the universe rather
than accept the simpler explanation proffered by
Copernicus. 
</blockquote><p>Faith is not necessarily true, no matter how ﬁrmly
held.</p><p>Some examples of such contemporary global and societal
fundamental mistakes include:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Western Intellectual Property Rights is legitimate and universal
</li><li class="li-itemize">Global warming is not real or is not serious
</li></ul><p>By “global fundamental mistakes” we mean the types of mistakes that put all of
us in danger.
Some global mistakes can, in due course, put humanity in danger.
The Western Intellectual Property Rights Regime is one such example.</p><p>Some global mistakes are not very harmful – they result in
sub-optimum societal/global human environments. “Ill Conception of The Metric System”
and “Backwards-ness Of Internet Domain Notation” are some such examples.</p><p>Contemporary global mistakes often result in entrenched vested interests. Such deep
economic interests often prevent people’s willingness to hear and follow basic logic.</p><p>In all cases, it is good to follow basic logic and understand these
basic global mistakes.</p><p>Those for whom recognition of falsehood of such global/societal beliefs is
difficult, can profit from remembering the history of American slavery of Africans.

we provide an overview of copyright law.</p><p>History of copyright law is generally very Western.</p><p>Copyright came about with the invention of the printing press and
with wider literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain
were from a reaction to printers’ monopolies at the beginning of
the 18th century. The English Parliament was concerned about the
unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing of the
Press Act 1662, which established a register of licensed books
and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers’ Company,
essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long
been in effect.</p><p>The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation.</p><p>The 1886 Berne Convention first established recognition of
copyrights among sovereign nations, rather than merely
bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for creative
works do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are
automatically in force at creation: an author need not "register"
or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne
Convention. As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or
recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically
entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative
works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or
until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted
in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic
authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed
the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of
it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act of 1988. Specially, for educational and
scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the
developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the
translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the
limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision
that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the
Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing
countries. The United States did not sign the Berne Convention
until 1989.</p><p>Iran<a id="hevea_default61"></a> is a non-signatory to WTO (Western Trade Organization) copyright laws.</p>

<a href="#sec%3AAboutPatentLaw">2.9.3</a> –
sec:AboutPatentLaw –,
we provide an overview of patent law.</p><p>History of patent law is generally very Western.</p><p>Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where
they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be
communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection
against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10
years. As
Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in
their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems to
other countries.</p><p>By the 16th century, the English Crown
would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for
monopolies. After public outcry, King James I of England (VI
of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and
declare that they were only to be used for "projects of new
invention". This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies
(1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown’s power
explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to
the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed
number of years. The Statute became the foundation for later
developments in patent law in England and elsewhere. James
Puckle’s 1718 early autocannon was one of the first inventions
required to provide a specification for a patent.</p><p>Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th
century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the
law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were
required to supply a complete specification of the principles of
operation of the invention for public access. Legal battles
around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam
engine, established the principles that patents could be issued
for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or
principles without specific practical application could also
legally be patented. Influenced by the philosophy of John
Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of
intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of
economic privilege.</p><p>The English legal system became the foundation for patent law in
countries with a common law heritage, including the United
States, New Zealand and Australia. In the Thirteen Colonies,
inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given
colony’s legislature. In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the
first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court
for a new process for making salt.</p><p>The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution
in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since
inventor’s right was considered as a natural one.</p><p>The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10,
1790, titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts".
The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790,</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec100" History Of Intellectual Property-->
<h3 id="sec100" class="subsection">5.2.4  History Of Intellectual Property</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The term Intellectual Property is an after thought. The history
of trademark, copyright and patent were well established before 
the very first introduction of the term “Intellectual Property”.</p><p>The first known use of the term intellectual property dates to
1769, when a piece published in the Monthly Review used the
phrase. The first clear example of modern usage goes back as
early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a
collection of essays.</p><p>The German equivalent was used with the founding of the North
German Confederation whose constitution granted legislative power
over the protection of intellectual property (Schutz des
geistigen Eigentums) to the confederation. When the
administrative secretariats established by the Paris Convention
(1883) and the Berne Convention (1886) merged in 1893, they
located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property
in their new combined title, the United International Bureaux for
the Protection of Intellectual Property.</p><p>The organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and
was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) by treaty as an agency
of the United Nations. According to Lemley, it was only at this
point that the term really began to be used in the United States
(which had not been a party to the Berne Convention), and it
did not enter popular usage there until passage of the Bayh-Dole
Act in 1980.</p>

<h2 id="sec101" class="section">5.3  Multi-Disciplinary Discrediting Of The Western So-Called IPR Regime</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Westerners adopted the IPR regime without much understanding and logic. </p><p>To take away those most basic natural human rights of “Applying Knowledge” and
“Copying” demands solid logic and proof on the side of those who want to take away these
rights. Those who believe in the Western IPR regime need to convince those who reject it.
Not the other way around.</p><p>In the last 200 years, a colossal mistake has been made by Westerners. Ownership and
capitalism were extended into the realm of poly-existentials, creating Intellectual
Property Rights.</p><p>Many generations have been born into this mistake and now the mistake has become default
truth for many Westerners.</p><p>So, to deal with Western IPR in the West we need more than logic. Below, we address some
of the entrenched fallacies associated with the Western IPR regime.</p><p>To those that are not born into the IPR mistake or who can 
think for themselves,
the simple logic of “Nature Of Poly-Existentials” that we presented above would be more
than sufficient. The conclusion is obvious and simple: The Western IPR Regime should be
abolished.</p><p>But, it is naive to imagine that sound logic and correct philosophy can be the basis for
abolishment of the Western IPR Regime.</p><p>This is because of a number of a reasons, including: 
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Intellectual Property Rights regime is now an integral part of Western cultures. Even
after it becomes obvious that the Western intellectual property rights regime is
corrupt, economic interests will keep it in place. In many ways this parallels the
history of Slavery in America.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Western societies are primarily economically driven. Correct philosophy, harmony
with nature, logic, and Halaal and Haraam; generally (if not always) remain fringe
concepts for Westerners.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The Proprietary model is fully entrenched. And the course for using the proprietary
model for internal and external exploitation is already fully charted.
</li></ul><p>As with any other social structure with the benefactors being in
power, and the victims seeing the structure as normal, it is very
difficult to change the status quo. Those promoting the Intellectual
Property Rights Regime have a vested interest in maintaining the
system and will do so at all cost. Abolishment of the Western IPR Regime must
begin with bringing a level of understanding of the exploitation and
conflict with nature of the IPR to those being disadvantaged by the
system.</p><p>Calling for abolishment of the Western IPR regime is reasonable. But in practical terms
we should recognize that it won’t be abolished. So, in parallel for that call we should
work on cures to this Western disease.</p><p>Our exposition in this part is polemic. This is not a debate. Nature is against
the Western IPR regime and we are on the side of nature.</p>

mistake: That of the ownership of poly-existentials. This time things
are more subtle and more difficult to understand, as the victims and
oppressors are less obvious.</p><p>The Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime

Western slavery was a sin of the West’s previous generations.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec103" Parallels Between Western Slavery And The Western IPR Regime-->
<h2 id="sec103" class="section">6.1  Parallels Between Western Slavery And The Western IPR Regime</h2><!--SEC END --><p>The parallel that we draw here is in the context of distorted or
proper “ownership rules” – not cruelty or kindness. 
When we use the words “Slave” and “Slavery”, we are purely
focused on the property and ownership aspect of a human by 
another human.</p><p>American/Western slavery of Africans is rooted in the American belief
of white superiority and black inferiority. Based on that belief
Americans/Westerners could then regard blacks
as subhuman and therefore “ownable”.
And, the revered United States Constitutional Convention could
at most get to The Three-Fifths Compromise.
Atrocities and involuntary servitude are then derivatives of ownership.
It is the notion of ownership laws that should be the focus.</p><p>In the case of slavery of Africans in America, the primary common
thought is the cruelty exercised by White Americans/Europeans against
Black Africans. That cruelty and racism was cemented through the
distortion of Laws of Ownership. Thus, even though in the case of
slavery, cruelty and racism are commonly viewed as dominant; it is
really the distortion of Laws of Ownership which should be viewed as
the causal mistake. In the context of parallels between western
slavery and the western IPR regime, our focus is distortion of
ownership rules first and the cruelty that it cultivates second. In
the case of the Western IPR regime, the cruelty is not as immediately
visible. Yet it is very real as well. In fact, we will argue that the
harm of the Western IPR regime will be far greater than that of
slavery – as the victims are more numerous and that recognition of
the cruelty is latent.</p><p>To understand our point, in the context of slavery of Africans in
America; the reader should view distortion of ownership rules primary
and cruelty and racism as secondary. Needless to say exploitation of
some by some-others, in the form of economic justifications (that
are full of externalities), is what drives that distortion of ownership
rules which then results in enduring cruelty and injustice.</p><p>In this section we focus on some parallels between Western
slavery And Western intellectual property rights regime.</p><p>We draw these parallels to show that the harm and dangers of Western
IPR ownership mistake surpass the previous Western ownership mistake
(Western Slavery).</p><p>Slavery had been practiced all over the world for thousands of years,
but never before had so many people from one continent been
transported to another against their will. American’s formality and
form of ownership was unique. The current size and make up of American
prisons are also very unique and exceptional. When we speak of
“Western Slavery”, it is this particular form of ownership and
slavery that we are pointing to.</p><p>It is not savagery and lack of humanity of American society that is
the point we wish to make in this section. We provide these example
to draw attention to long term ramifications of Western ownership
mistakes in general and the current Western IPR regime mistake in
particular. American Slavery<a id="hevea_default62"></a> is the previous now well understood 
Western ownership mistake.</p><p>Below we go through various aspects of these colossal Western mistakes
that have obvious parallels and similarities.</p>

<!--TOC subsection id="sec105" Ownership Of Human Beings-->
<h3 id="sec105" class="subsection">6.2.1  Ownership Of Human Beings</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Western Slavery was about very formal ownership of human beings. 
Despite full formality, Western Slavery was
without regard for ramifications of interbreeding with what you
own. And the question of ownership of your own child.</p><p>Today, a First Lady of America,
Michelle Obama<a id="hevea_default63"></a>, has no comment about her own genealogy. At the age of
six, Melvinia<a id="hevea_default64"></a>, who was Michelle Obama’s great-great-great grandmother,
was passed on as <span style="font-weight:bold">property</span> (valued at $475 
) to Paterson’s daughter and son-in-law -
Christianne and Henry Shields - after his death in 1852. Some years
later, when she was still a teenager, she gave birth to a boy, Dolphus
T Shields. Dolphus was recorded in the census as "mulatto" - denoting
one white and one black parent. The identity of the father is not
known, though the fact that his surname was Shields suggests he may
have been a member of the family that <span style="font-weight:bold">owned</span> Melvinia<a id="hevea_default65"></a>.</p><p>In the 19th century, in America, human beings were formally owned.
Interbreeding with one’s property was common place and the master’s
own child became property again. On this scale and in this form, all
of this is exceptionally American.</p><p>So, now in the 21st century, for the very first time we have the
descendants of a salve as America’s First Lady. The ancestors of
the President himself, Barack Obama<a id="hevea_default66"></a>, do not
seem to have been slaves. Americans have not yet chosen a
descendant of their slaves as President.</p><p>Note here that the modern term “African-American” is quite
confusing. Both Michelle Obama<a id="hevea_default67"></a> and Barack Obama<a id="hevea_default68"></a> are called
African-Americans. Barack Obama<a id="hevea_default69"></a> is a descendant of Africans who chose
to become American. Just like the Irish-Americans (say John
F. Kennedy). Michelle Obama<a id="hevea_default70"></a> is a descendant of African

for becoming American.</p>

<h3 id="sec108" class="subsection">6.3.1  Slaves And The Cotton Economy</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The rise of "King Cotton" as the defining feature of southern life
revitalized slavery. The promise of cotton profits encouraged a
spectacular rise in the direct importation of African slaves in
the late 18th century and early 19th century.
250,000 new slaves arrived in the United States from 1787 to
1808, a number equal to the entire slave importation of the colonial
period. </p><p>Cotton also contributed to the national economy. The crop comprised
more than half the total value of domestic exports in the period
1815-1860, and in 1860, earnings from cotton paid for 60 percent of
all imports. Cotton also built up domestic capital, attracted foreign
investment, and contributed to the industrial growth. In
the early 1800s, northeastern merchants began channeling commercial
profits into industrial production of cloth (using cotton).</p><p>So, much American prosperity was built on the back of African slaves. In
that economic process, Americans destroyed an entire continent and an
entire people (cultures, languages, customs, etc.).</p><p>Economics is inherently full of externalities.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec109" Viagra Patents and Pfizer-->

rapidly after launch, and those of its competitors fell dramatically.</p><p>All of Viagra profits are anchored in a set of patents.</p><p>The target for Viagra is the 50 year old man who is having
trouble and is very willing to pay for his trouble.</p><p>So, we can see how the Western patent system, has focused innovation

<h2 id="sec116" class="section">6.6  America’s Founding Fathers and the US Constitution</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Many Americans take the US constitution very seriously and regard 
“America’s Founding Fathers” as reverend.</p><p>The US Constitution has been exceptionally wrong both with respect to
Slavery and IPR.</p><p>These catastrophic mistakes of the US Constitution are fundamentally
rooted in the economic nature of this document. Above all, US
Constitution is a business plan – by the business-man for the
business-man. “Freedom” is included in that business plan as a
business ingredient. Individual Freedom in due course will be extended
to include Corporate Freedom. Freedom of the weak is viewed as a source
of income.</p><p>The American two layers model of law and economics is very simple.
And in that simple two layered model, one important purpose of law is
to accommodate economics. People are viewed as economic creatures. And
society is the collection of economic creatures and their economic dynamics. A
very simple and effective business plan.</p><p>Human beings born into this colossal American business plan – The US
Constitution –, in no time become economic creatures. They become
Americanized.</p><p>To pay lip service to any remaining human needs of economic creatures,
individualistic freedom becomes the main pillar of American morality.
Conveniently, the US Constitution and the American economic model
celebrates individual freedoms. Based on those individualistic
freedoms, the sophisticated American corporation is then well
positioned to manipulate the naive American individual – that simple
economic creature. With that form of American morality in place, the
American corporation then demands those individualistic freedoms for
itself. The American model then amounts to a complete collection of
economic creatures (people and corporations alike). Should such a
collection be called a society? What is American society?</p><p>Humans are to be first right and wrong (halaal and haraam) oriented and 
only after that, they should be economically oriented.
Right and wrong are often orthogonal to economics and profit, as
externality is an inherent characteristic of economics.</p><p>The notion of focusing on right and wrong instead of economics is
generally foreign to Americans.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec117" Slavery And The US Constitution-->
<h3 id="sec117" class="subsection">6.6.1  Slavery And The US Constitution</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Slavery is seen in the US Constitution in a few key places. </p><p>The first is in the Enumeration Clause, where representatives are
apportioned. Each state is given a number of representatives based on
its population - in that population, slaves, called "other persons,"
are counted as three-fifths of a whole person. This compromise was
hard-fought, with Northerners wishing that slaves, legally property,
be uncounted, much as mules and horses are uncounted. Southerners,
however, well aware of the high proportion of slaves to the total
population in their states, wanted them counted as whole persons
despite their legal status. The three-fifths number was a ratio used
by the Congress in contemporary legislation and was agreed upon with
little debate.</p><p>In Article 1, Section 9, Congress is limited, expressly, from
prohibiting the "Importation" of slaves, before 1808. The slave trade
was a bone of contention for many, with some who supported slavery
abhorring the slave trade. The 1808 date, a compromise of 20 years,
allowed the slave trade to continue, but placed a date-certain on its
survival. </p><p>The Fugitive Slave Clause
is the last mention. In it, a problem that slave states had with
extradition of escaped slaves was resolved. The laws of one state, the
clause says, cannot excuse a person from "Service or Labour" in
another state. The clause expressly requires that the state in which
an escapee is found deliver the slave to the state he escaped from "on
Claim of the Party."</p><p>So, here we have America’s founding fathers, speaking of how all men
are created equal during the day and then banging their slaves at
night. And who knows who is to own the results of all that banging –
their own children. </p><p>So, now early in the 21st century, some African American are seeking
to prove a genetic link to James Madison<a id="hevea_default71"></a>.</p><p>This of course provides a window for understanding the character of
America’s founding fathers – and by extension a window to the
character of American society.</p>

trade one may consider the following anecdotes. Many priests
themselves carried on slave-trading, especially in Angola, and many
others owned slaves in the Americas. The only reason the Catholic
church give for its action was that it was trying to save African
souls by baptizing the slaves. The Protestants were worse, for they
did not even make it clear that they accepted that the Africans had a
soul. Instead, they supported the view that the African slave was a
piece of property like a furniture or a domestic animal. There is no
part of the history of Christian church which was more disgraceful
than its support of the Atlantic slave-trade.</p><p>When ships loaded with human cargo sailed from Christian countries to
Western hemisphere, Christian priests used to bless the ship in the
name of Almighty and admonish the slaves to be obedient. It never
entered into their minds to admonish the masters to be kind to the
slaves.</p><p>Islam’s historical record with respect to slavery is much cleaner than
Christianity’s record. </p><p>Malcolm X said that Islam was the "true religion of black mankind" and
that Christianity was "the white man’s religion" that had been imposed
upon African Americans by their slave-masters.</p><p>In a Christian country, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., chose to become

Boldrin and Levine examine both the evidence and the theory of

that IP does not increase either innovation or

all amount to symptoms analysis and do not go to the root of the
problem. They do not explicitly and strongly call for the
abolition of IPR. They also do not move towards the right
solutions – Halaalness of manner-of-existence of
poly-existentials. And in the current Western environment where
very powerful entities are in control of economy, legislation and
Western society, such opposition amounts to academic naggings.
In this document, we want to do more than that.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is clear that even in the West there is a large size awareness of the
notion that the IPR regime is a grave mistake.
Many Westerners have reached the correct conclusion that: there
is no such thing as a right to own intangible ideas and, therefore,
the whole regime of grants of monopoly is an unjust and outdated
political construct that should be tossed aside. </p><p>Yet these Western awarenesses are not profound.
As Demings puts it:

balances in delineating what can be protected and what cannot, determining what uses are
permitted without a license, and establishing appropriate enforcement mechanisms to
combat piracy, so that all stakeholders benefit from the protection afforded by
copyright.

<h2 id="sec137" class="section">7.5  Falacy: Copyright Law Restricts Plagiarism</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Martin, in [<a href="#IPR-BrianMartin">27</a>], puts it this way:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Many intellectual workers fear being plagiarised and many of
them think that intellectual property provides protection against
this. After all, without copyright, why couldn’t someone put their
name on your essay and publish it? Actually, copyright provides
very little protection against plagiarism. So-called “moral
rights” of authors to be credited are backed by law in many
countries but are an extremely cumbersome way of dealing with
plagiarism.
Plagiarism means using the ideas of others without adequate
acknowledgment. There are several types of plagiarism. One is
plagiarism of ideas: someone takes your original idea and, using
different expression, presents it as their own. Copyright provides
no protection at all against this form of plagiarism. Another type
of plagiarism is word-for-word plagiarism, where someone takes
the words you’ve written—a book, an essay, a few paragraphs or
even just a sentence—and, with or without minor modifications,
presents them as their own. This sort of plagiarism is covered by
copyright—assuming that you hold the copyright. In many
cases, copyright is held by the publisher, not the author.<p>In practice, plagiarism goes on all the time, in various ways
and degrees, and copyright law is hardly ever used against it.
The most effective challenge to plagiarism is not legal action but
publicity. At least among authors, plagiarism is widely condemned. 
For this reason, and because they seek to give credit
where it’s due, most writers do take care to avoid plagiarising.
There is an even more fundamental reason why copyright
provides no protection against plagiarism: the most common sort
of plagiarism is built into social hierarchies. Government and
corporate reports are released under the names of top bureaucrats 
who did not write them; politicians and corporate executives give
speeches written by underlings. These are examples of
a pervasive misrepresentation of authorship in which powerful
figures gain credit for the work of subordinates. Copyright, if
it has any effect at all, reinforces rather than challenges this sort
of institutionalised plagiarism.
</p></blockquote><p>To frame this in concrete terms, consider the following real case:</p><blockquote class="quote">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17, 1987 — Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
fighting to salvage his Presidential campaign, today acknowledged
”a mistake” in his youth, when he plagiarized a law review
article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.
Mr. Biden insisted, however, that he had done nothing
”malevolent,” that he had simply misunderstood the need to cite
sources carefully. And he asserted that another controversy,
concerning recent reports of his using material from others’
speeches without attribution, was ”much ado about nothing.”

case. What Biden had done never caused any harm or challenge
to anyone’s copyright monopoly.</p>

<h2 id="sec141" class="section">7.9  On IP Placibos And Self-Fulﬁlling Prophecies</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Gold et al. in [<a href="#IPR-GoldMorin">24</a>] note:</p><blockquote class="quote">
The underlying intuition of a placebo, or self-fulﬁlling prophecy,
is well described by Merton as follows: “A false deﬁnition of the
situation evoking behavior which makes the originally false
conception come true”. The danger with these
situations is that they lead to strong claims that are false. As
Merton explains, “the prophet will cite the actual course of events
as proof that he was right from the beginning”. In
other words, the deﬁning characteristic of a placebo is that it is
the very consequences of the belief that make reality conform to the
initial belief and that believers “fail to understand how their own
belief has helped to construct that reality”.
The economics literature has its own treatment of placebos and
self-fulﬁlling prophecies. These arise in economies presenting
multiple potential equilibria in which untested expectations
non-trivially determine the equilibrium into which they eventually
fall. These expectations “are
unrelated to the preferences, endowments or production set of any
individual, and yet come to inﬂuence the forecast and actions of
economic decision-makers” . We
can regard economic outcomes as the sum of two distinct effects: (i)
direct (structural) effects and (ii) indirect (behavioral) effects.
A growth model with strong indirect
effects would exhibit placebo characteristics. Where different
groups of individuals hold beliefs based on distinct yet false
conceptions – such as one group believing in the effect of sunspots
and another in those of “moonspots” – each will ﬁnd “factual”
support for their beliefs, leading to increased faith (and, hence,
stability) in the false belief. <p>A policymaker who knows that economic growth is 
driven by indirect, rather than direct, effects of IP has greater
room to increase growth by exerting inﬂuence on individuals’ beliefs
and behavior rather than through increasing levels of IP
protection. For example, she could focus on changing beliefs –
through education – or on inducing the same behavior through other
means at a lower cost. Yu suggests that a
self-fulﬁlling prophecy lay in China’s decision to embrace higher
levels of IP protection (facially, at least) in the late 1970s after
it opened its markets to foreign trade. He argues that while this
increased protection had no direct effect on growth, inevitably some
sectors and regions would see economic growth after (but not
causally related to) the change. Observers then wrongly attributed
this growth to the direct effect of IP and called for even greater
levels of IP protection. “And,” Yu notes, “the cycle would repeat
itself”. Our theory generalizes and adds precision
to Yu’s suggestion. It holds that IP as written in formal laws –
rather than how these laws operate in practice – has less of a
direct role in inﬂuencing growth than thought. Instead, a group of
foreign investors, believing (even if falsely) that IP always drives
growth, invest in countries that adopt these laws without
necessarily engaging the IP system itself (e.g. by actually
obtaining, defending, and licensing IP rights). There are various
reasons why such actors may hold these beliefs even in the absence
of direct economic effects, ranging from the symbolic – higher
levels of IP protection signal a pro-investor policy environment –
to the mystical – that IP will inevitably lead the country to higher
rates of growth. In the end, the result is the same: actors’ faith
in the growth effects of increased IP protection drives investment
and thus leads to growth despite the absence of direct causality.
</p></blockquote><p>Gold et al. in [<a href="#IPR-GoldMorin">24</a>] conclude that:</p><blockquote class="quote">
[The presented results] are consistent with the
placebo theory that states that a belief in the positive effects of
increases in levels of IP protection on growth drive both formal IP
and investments made in an economy.
</blockquote><p>What Gold et al. fail to recognize is that their analogy between IP and placebo
is off in one very important respect.
With respect to the placebo effect, they make it clear that IP is
unnecessary – and they are correct in that regard. However, the
placebo is designed to be harmless, but IP is harmful and evil.</p><p>Economists should note that economic analysis is always full of

... reveals one remarkable characteristic in the evolution of

international character. By spontaneous I mean that the evolution
toward a relative consensus about the property concept was not
organized from a single center. It was neither the product of a
brilliant Lycurgean legislator or the outcome of the action of an
organized social group. The growing consensus about the property
concept evolved from a dialogue among learned jurists from different
parts of the European continent. This dialogue was an ongoing
intellectual process lasting several centuries. The jurists of
France, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, and Italy consulted foreign
texts, commented on them, and gradually refined their theoretical
approach. Although this spontaneous origin of the property concept
does not provide a conclusive argument for its rightness, it reveals
at least its intersubjective and intertemporal character. The least
we can say is that the property theory of the continental legal
tradition passed through a test of a multitude of critical insights
of learned and experienced legal scholars. For this reason, it is
legitimate to assign to such a gradually evolved theory a
presumption of rightness and to charge its opponents with the burden
of proof about the contrary.

intellectual property on the continent suggests a negative answer to
this question. The origin of intellectual property rights has its
historical roots in deliberate interventions by political
authorities rather than in the spontaneously evolved continental
legal tradition.

One problem with the [labor-based or] creation-based approach is
that it almost invariably protects only certain types of creations—
unless, that is, every single useful idea one comes up with is
subject to ownership (more on this below). But the distinction
between the protectable and the unprotectable is necessarily
arbitrary. For example, philosophical or mathematical or scientific
truths cannot be protected under current law on the grounds that
commerce and social intercourse would grind to a halt were every new
phrase, philosophical truth, and the like considered the exclusive
property of its creator. For this reason, patents can be obtained
only for so-called “practical applications” of ideas, but not for
more abstract or theoretical ideas. Rand agrees with this disparate
treatment, in attempting to distinguish between an unpatentable
discovery and a patentable invention. She argues that a “scientific
or philosophical discovery, which identifies a law of nature, a
principle or a fact of reality not previously known” is not created
by the discoverer. But the distinction between creation and
discovery is not clearcut or rigorous. Nor is it clear why such a
distinction, even if clear, is ethically relevant in defining
property rights. No one creates matter; they just manipulate and
grapple with it according to physical laws. In this sense, no one
really creates anything. They merely rearrange matter into new
arrangements and patterns. An engineer who invents a new mousetrap
has rearranged existing parts to provide a function not previously
performed. Others who learn of this new arrangement can now also
make an improved mousetrap. Yet the mousetrap merely follows laws of
nature. The inventor did not invent the matter out of which the
mousetrap is made, nor the facts and laws exploited to make it work.<p>...</p><p>Both the inventor and the theoretical scientist engage in creative
mental effort to produce useful, new ideas. Yet one is rewarded, and
the other is not. In one recent case, the inventor of a new way to

justifies the seemingly immoral “means” of restricting the freedom of
individuals to use their physical property as they see fit.</p><p>This would be based on the assumption that wealth or utility could be
maximized by adopting certain legal rules. Unless this assumption is
proved correct no conclusions are of any consequence. In fact we
believe that this assumption is false.</p><p>But for now, let us suppose that it is correct.</p><p>Kinsella, in [<a href="#IPR-StephanKinsell">26</a>] addresses this:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Even then, this does not show that these rules
are justified. For example, one could argue that net utility
is enhanced by redistributing half of the wealth of society’s
richest one percent to its poorest ten percent. But even if
stealing some of A’s property and giving it to B increases
B’s welfare “more” than it diminishes A’s (if such a comparison could, somehow, be made), this does not establish
that the theft of A’s property is justified. Wealth maximization is not the goal of law; rather, the goal is justice—giving
each man his due. Even if overall wealth is increased due
to IP laws, it does not follow that this allegedly desirable
result justifies the unethical violation of some individuals’
rights to use their own property as they see fit.<p>...</p><p>It is debatable whether copyrights and patents really are necessary to
encourage the production of creative works and inventions, or that the
incremental gains in innovation outweigh the immense costs of an IP
system.</p><p>Econometric studies do not conclusively show net gains in
wealth. Perhaps there would even be more innovation if
there were no patent laws; maybe more money for research
and development (R&amp;D) would be available if it were not
being spent on patents and lawsuits. It is possible that companies would have an even greater incentive to innovate if
they could not rely on a near twenty-year monopoly.</p><p>...</p><p>It is not clear that society is better off with relatively more
practical invention and relatively less theoretical research
and development. </p><p>...</p><p>We must remember that when we advocate certain
rights and laws, and inquire into their legitimacy, we are
inquiring into the legitimacy and ethics of the use of force.
To ask whether a law should be enacted or exist is to ask:
is it proper to use force against certain people in certain
circumstances? It is no wonder that this question is not
really addressed by analysis of wealth maximization. </p><p>Utilitarian analysis is thoroughly confused and bankrupt: talk
about increasing the size of the pie is methodologically
flawed; there is no clear evidence that the pie increases with
IP rights. Further, pie growth does not justify the use of
force against the otherwise legitimate property of others.
For these reasons, utilitarian IP defenses are unpersuasive.

mono-existential component, some 
IP advocates shift from a purely
contractual approach to a “reservation of rights” approach
in which property rights in mono-existentials tangible resources are seen as a
divisible bundle of rights.</p><p>Kinsela in [<a href="#IPR-StephanKinsell">26</a>] describes this in some detail:</p><blockquote class="quote">
For example, under the standard bundle-of-rights view, a landowner
can sell the mineral estate to an oil company while retaining all
rights to the surface, except for an easement (servitude) granting
passage to a neighbor and a life estate (usufruct) granting use of
the surface estate to his mother. Drawing on the bundle-of-rights
notion, the “reservation of rights” approach holds that a type of
“private” IP can be privately generated by creatively “reserving
rights” to reproduce tangible items sold to purchasers. Rothbard,
for example, argues that one can grant conditional “ownership” (of
“knowledge”) to another, while “retaining the ownership power to
disseminate the knowledge of the invention.” Or, Brown, the inventor
of an improved mousetrap, can stamp it “copyright” and thereby sell
the right to each mousetrap except for the right to reproduce
it. Like the real rights accompanying statutory IP, such
“reservations” allegedly bind everyone, not just those who have
contracted with the original seller. Thus, third parties who become
aware of, purchase, or otherwise come into possession of the
restricted item also cannot reproduce it—not because they have
entered into a contract with Brown, but because “no one can acquire
a greater property title in something than has already been given
away or sold.” In other words, the third party acquires a tangible
thing—a book or a mousetrap, say—but it is somehow “missing” the
“right-to-copy” part of the bundle of rights that “normally”
constitutes all rights to the thing. Or, the third party acquires
“ownership” of information, from a person who did not own the
information and, thus, was not entitled to transmit it to others.
</blockquote><p>The implications of such a view are troubling. Palmer in [<a href="#IPR-Palmer">28</a>]
writes:</p><blockquote class="quote">
The separation and retention of the right to copy from the bundle of
rights that we call property is problematic. Could one reserve the
right, for example, to remember something? Suppose that I wrote a
book and offered it to you to read, but I had retained one right:
the right to remember it. Would I be justified in taking you to
court if I could prove that you had remembered the name of the lead
character in the book?

<h2 id="sec157" class="section">8.2  The Paralyzing Effects Of Western IPR On Health Of Professions</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Each profession has a responsibility to society towards protecting a certain aspect of
life.</p><p>Here we are using the term “profession” in the way it is understood in the East.</p><p>The notion of a “profession” in the West consists of training and the acquisition of
specialized skills, to perform specialized work, to create monetary income. The
responsibility of a profession towards society at large does not factor significantly in
this. Western society is mostly, if not totally, economically driven. The Western model of
economically driven individuals existing within an industrial context considers only money
and self-interest. Such broader concepts as society, profession, responsibility and
respect are very weak in the Western model.</p><p>In the East the word “profession” carries a greater meaning. It
includes the Western meaning of a specialized skill set to perform
work of value to others. But it also includes an agenda of trust and
responsibility. The professional person is entrusted by society to
maintain guardianship over an important aspect of life. Based on
proper execution of this responsibility, the profession is respected.</p><p>The primary author of this essay, attests that:
for him as an engineer it is only in Iran that he is called “Mr. Engineer Banan<a id="hevea_default90"></a>.” That has
never happened to him in America, Canada, England, France, or anywhere else in his travels
throughout the Western world.</p><p>So it is in this Eastern sense that we are here speaking of “professional
responsibility.”</p><p>An indirect consequence of the Western IPR regime is empowerment of Financiers,
Corporations and Corpocracy<a id="hevea_default91"></a>.</p><p>An indirect consequence of the Western IPR regime is detriment of Professions, society and
individual.</p><p>A particularly powerful tool of business to dominate and crush
professions is the so called Intellectual Property regime. The
recognition that by rejecting Patents, Copyrights and the norms of
trade secrecy many professions can protect themselves against business
dominance is badly absent in most professions.</p><p>Journalism can be more productive and resistant to business corruption
by rejecting copyright and adopting copyleft. Pharmaceutical,
Bio-Medicine and Medicine can be more productive and resistant to
business corruption by rejecting patents and adopting the patent-free
model.</p><p>The software engineering profession has already demonstrated how by
adopting the copyleft and patent-free models it can resist dominance
by business. GNU/Linux has stood up against the Microsoft monopoly.</p><p>The principles of the software engineering profession’s collaborative
model can be reapplied to many other professions.</p><p>In essence the solution is in properly defining poly-existential
capitalism.</p><p>Consider the Software Engineering profession, which is hindered by the Western so-called
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime. As engineers instead of being able to freely
collaborate, we are enticed to compete. Instead of collectively inventing and innovating
towards the good of society, the Western IPR model pushes us to individually reinvent.</p><p>Software and Internet Services have become an integral and critical component of societal
functioning, and the consequences for humanity are enormous. Of fundamental importance in
this regard is what we will call the <em>manner of existence</em> of software.</p><p>We present the Halaal <em>manner of existence</em> of software and Internet services in:

The Western IPR regime adversely impacts our ability to produce Libre-Halaal software and Internet services.</p><p>It is for this reason that we are writing this paper. While poly-existentials are far
broader than software, we emphasis software in this presentation for two reasons. First,
we are software engineers. Second, the collaborative and cumulative and usage orientation
of software (as a poly-existential) permits us to demonstrate the natural power of
poly-existentials in contrast to Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
regime. This of course is demonstrated in success of the Libre-Halaal GNU/Linux in contrast to
the proprietary MS Windows.</p>

creatures and that if they are not economically rewarded they will not
engage as much in activities that progress science and useful arts.
Western IPR regime assumes that human beings are competition oriented and
collaborative values are inferior to competition for advancement of 
science and useful arts.</p><p>Economics is the study of what people do when nothing more
important than money is at stake. Even though twenty first
century planet earth is too primitive to be generally governed by
anything but economics, there are variations for the place of
economics in societies. Western IPR is fully rooted in economics. The
Western IPR regime was created and is being promoted in this
American context. </p><p>To the extent that it can be considered a culture, the American
culture understands this – and is proud of it. In the movie “Killing
Them Softly”, the actor Brad Pitt, in a key scene, puts it like this:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>“This guy [Obama] wants to tell me we are living in a comunity.
Don’t make me laugh. I’m living in America and in America you are on

</p></blockquote><p>It is in this pure business sense that Wester Intellectual Property
exists.</p><p>Right and wrong are often orthogonal to economics and profit, as
externality is an inherent characteristic of economics.
In the
spirit of combating west-toxication «غرب زدگی», [<a href="#Repub-120024">23</a>], Imam Khomeini, captured
this difference in a short crisp sentence: “basis of everything for the donkey too is its economics” – «الاغ هم زیربنای همه چیزش اقتصادش
است». <sup><a id="text3" href="#note3">1</a></sup>
Our model for humanity is inherently complex and intertwines:
religion, morality, ethics, economics, business, law, language, culture, society
and nature. Western IPR regime is not rooted in harmony with nature,
morality or ethics.</p><p>To pay lip service to any remaining human needs of economic creatures, individualism and
individualistic freedom becomes the main pillar of Western morality. Conveniently, the
Western economics model celebrates individual freedoms. Based on those individualistic
freedoms, the sophisticated Western corporation is then well positioned to manipulate the
naive Western individual. With that form of Western morality in place, the Western
corporation then demands those individualistic freedoms for itself. The American/Western
legal system then kicks in and formalizes the Western legal notions of “corporate
personhood”. The Western model then amounts to a complete collection of economic
creatures (people and corporations alike). 
Should such a collection be called a society?
What is Western society?
It is inside of this model that the Western IPR regime has thrived.</p>

<a id="sec:ProprietaryAmericanistValues"></a>
</p><p>The concepts and laws of IPR has been shaped by proprietary American values.
And this is the root cause of the problem.
In particular, the proprietary American model is based on:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Supremacy<a id="hevea_default94"></a> of business and economics – Leaving no room for societal, social,
philosophical or moral considerations in the base fabric of society.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Unbounded Corporations. The Corporation, an entity whose sole purpose is to generate
profit is permitted to do all that it pleases and in many respects is considered
equivalent with human individuals. This model reduces humans to the level of Corporations –
greed driven psychopaths.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Elimination or marginalization of role of professions (Internet Engineering) in society.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Corpocracy<a id="hevea_default95"></a> – Where collaboration of Corporation and Government results in
manipulation and control of the People.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Extreme Individualism<a id="hevea_default96"></a> – Rampant Self-Toxication At Epidemic Levels. 
Stressing personal freedoms, out of balance against 
significance of health of society and humanity,
play well into manipulation of individuals by corporations.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Uses of IPR as an instrument to exploit other societies and cultures. Based on
American Exceptionalism.
</li></ul><p>These dynamics are such that proprietary American model puts not just America, but the 
entirety of human civilization in danger.</p><p>The American model is being portrayed to the world as universal.
It is not. There is more to the world than the American regime. 
The American regime has produced well understood results for other crucial
aspects of life that the civilized world has fully rejected.
Much of the world wishes to be separate from the American regime.</p><p>Americanism is inherently exploitative. It often results into
short term prosperity for its practitioners at a cost to
others. Sometimes the practitioners don’t recognize that they are
also the others.</p><p>Consider how Americans eat. The American “Food Inc<a id="hevea_default97"></a>.” model has turned the American
farmer into instruments of agro-business machinery of patented economic
processes. Partaking food by humans has been turned into manipulation of the economic
creatures by the business. Human beings have been turned into economic creatures existing
in an industrial context for the purpose of the business of consuming food. Obesity is
prevalent amongst the poor in America.</p><p>Consider how Americans take care of their sick. Health and medicine has been fully
subjected to capitalism. Everyone for himself. The doctor-patient relationship has become
a fully economic transaction. Insurance business has been placed on the top and the
patient at the very bottom while the American doctor has become nothing more than a tool
of business. 
The rich think that this works very well for them. In the aggregate, it is a miserable
failure. For example, Cuba with a fraction of resources produces infant mortality rate
results that compare very well against the American Regime’s. 
The obvious human model of universal health
care which is practiced through out the civilized world is considered nasty socialism in
America.</p><p>Consider how Americans view prescription medications. The Anglo-American culture permits
advertising of prescription drugs on Television. Nowhere else in the world is this
permitted. The exclusive producer of the patented medication is permitted to dangle the
cure in front of the sick in public – and hardly any American recognizes 
this as a clear sign for the road to end of civilization and humanity.
The profession of medicine is by-passed by the
business where the sick is encouraged to tell the doctor what to do.</p><p>Consider how Americans consider university education. The average American graduate comes
out $35K in debt. 
The American higher education system is for the rich and the
indebted. 
The purpose of education has become preparation for economic
activity.
American academia has been fully corporatized. 
In the American model, learning too has become a purely economic activity.</p><p>Consider how Americans view their guns. When extreme individualism is at the center,
ridiculous arguments for ridiculous freedoms become the norm. The distance from there, to
“going postal”, “Columbine”, “Sandy Hook”, etc. is very little. American savagery
is truly exceptional!</p><p>Consider how Americans view relations with other
societies. America’s short history points to exploitation,
colonialism, dominance and imperialism as clear trends. The
natives are now concentrated in reservations. The African
continent has been destroyed and the African languages and
cultures were bulldozed into oblivion. Descendants of those
African slaves are now a majority in American prisons. The use
of the atomic bomb, the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, was
initiated by Americans. The CIA’s clandestine coups to manipulate
and exploit Iranians, Arabs, South-Americans, etc. are celebrated
and glamorized through the 
American
Hollywood. The patterns of Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and
Syria point to the inability of Americans to listen, understand
and learn.</p><p>Much of the civilized world has looked at these American models and has fully rejected them.</p><p>When Americans try to impose their models for mono-existentials on
others, rejections of these American models by the rest of the world,
often takes the form of: “Yankee Go Home”, “Go To Hell Yankee” and
“Death To America” chants followed by physical rejection and
separation. And that has kind of worked for some – e.g., the 1979
Iranian Revolution.</p><p>But rejection of Americanist models for poly-existentials is more
complicated.</p>

</p><p>It is naive to imagine that sound logic and advocation of morality,
ethics and philosophy can stop the exploitative patterns and offenses
that Americanists have established as a pattern. </p><p>The Americanists don’t believe in repentance. They have never
acknowledged and apologized for the genocide of the natives, the
destruction of Africa and its cultures and languages or any other of
their atrocities. The concept of the need for reparations for the
damages that they have caused is foreign to Americanists. The notion
of reviewing their actions and feeling contrition or regret for past
wrongs is not part of Americanism.</p><p>If it was to be left to the Americanists, there is every reason to
expect that the above mentioned self-toxications, bullying,
destruction and uncivilized patterns of exploitation will be repeated.</p><p>Given these trends, should the world accept the American regime’s
model of IPR for poly-existence and poly-existentials which
Americanists propagate in the form of so-called Intellectual Property
as tools for continued exploitations?</p><!--TOC section id="sec164" Exclusion Of Americanism From Poly-Existentials Governance-->

</p><p>The Japanese/Brazilian/Iranian/Chinese/French/Cuban/Indian/Russian/etc models for food,
medicine, university education and guns are distinctly different from the American
model. Much of the civilized world looks at the American model and sees a purely
economically oriented savage model. This of course is very different from what Americans
see when they look in the mirror. This degree of self-absorption and these extremes of
American monocultures of the mind are genuinely exceptional.</p><p>Unlike, food, guns and medicine (mono-existentials) which are inherently local, the
inherent poly-existential nature of IPR restriction is global.
Adoption of the purely proprietary American model of IPR
puts civilization and humanity in danger.</p><p>Rejection of the American proprietary model of the Internet is far more complicated than
rejecting the local American models of food, medicine, guns, etc. Slogans and chants are
ineffective and complete physical separation is impractical. 
A large segment of the planet has already come to recognize that the 
greatest threat to humanity is Americanism. It is wholly wrong to allow the 
Proprietary American IPR to become a propagation vehicle for Americanism.
It should not be permitted.</p><p>The Americanist’s Intelectual Property Rights model of governance of
poly-existentials is rooted in extreme individualism
and self-toxication.
Instead we want to adopt a human oriented model for governance of poly-existentials.</p><p>Saadi,  «سعدی» , has well expressed this
distinction between self-toxicated economic creatures and
humans:</p><p><br>
<br>
</p><p>2
Human beings are members of a whole<br>
In creation of one essence and soul<br>
If one member is afflicted with pain<br>
Other members uneasy will remain<br>
If you have no sympathy for human pain<br>
The name of human you cannot retain<br>

<h1 id="sec166" class="chapter">Chapter 10  Dynamics Of Informative, Academic, Promulgative, Tangible and Theoretical Cures</h1><!--SEC END --><p>The purpose of writing this document has not been just to analyze the
IPR problem.
Proposing and analyzing solutions are an equally important aspect of this document.</p><p>What can be done? By Whom? How? </p><p>For any of the proposed solutions to be significant, solutions need to
be at societal level and exposition of concepts in this document are
geared towards establishing societal relationships.</p><p>We view the Western so-called IPR Regime as a disease. It is a sick
way of thinking and a sick way of behaving that becomes an inherent
condition. It is abnormal in that it is against nature of
poly-existentials. This disease can spread from one society to the
next. It is like alcoholism, it brings short term pleasure but long
term despair. Not just for the alcoholic but for all concerned.</p><p>We therefore label our effort to restore societal behavior to its normal condition
(Libre-Halaal Poly-Existentials) not a solution to a problem but a cure for the disease.</p><p>In context of cures, there are 3 dimensions of scope that need to be recognized:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
What types of poly-existentials (corresponding/mapping to professions) should be
initial primary focuses? By types of poly-existentials we are referring to digitals,
software, internet services, knowledge in general, knowledge of medications, etc.</li><li class="li-enumerate">Which societies should we focus on? Eastern cures are
inherently different from what may be applicable to the West.
Furthermore, in the IPR context economic interests of East and West
are different. It is possible for the Libre-Halaal model to do an
economic number on the Western IPR based Proprietary model.</li><li class="li-enumerate">What general type of activities do we focus on?
By type of activities we are referring to informative, 
academic, promulgative, tangible, or theoretical.</li></ol><p>Prior to selecting our focal points, we need to analyze the battle ground.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec167" Dynamics of the Proprietary-Haraam vs. Libre-Halaal Battle-->
<h2 id="sec167" class="section">10.1  Dynamics of the Proprietary-Haraam vs. Libre-Halaal Battle</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Endorsement of the Western IPR model leads to the Proprietary-Haraam
manner-of-existence of poly-existentials which then usually leads to
the competition oriented internally opaque digital entities.</p><p>Rejection of the Western IPR model can lead to the Libre-Halaal
manner-of-existence of poly-existentials which then leads to
the collaborative oriented internally transparent digital entities.</p><p>In software’s context, though this is not part of popular
cultural awareness, there is currently a titanic battle taking
place between two competing ideologies: the Proprietary-Haraam
model (exemplified by Windows), and the
Libre-Halaal<a id="hevea_default98"></a> model (exemplified by
GNU/Linux). This is a to-the-death battle, from which there can
eventually emerge only a single winner.</p><p>Of course, this battle is part of a broader ideological contest,
about ownership models for poly-existentials in general
(software, but also including ideas, knowledge, literature,
music, images, movies, etc.) in the digital era. Current
ownership models are rooted in the historical conventions and
institutions of material products and materially-based
services. In the case of abstract constructs such as software,
these conventions appear in the form of the existing Intellectual
Property (IP) regime, where proprietary ownership is asserted by
means of patents and copyright.</p><p>But the inherent nature of software, Internet services and other poly-existentials is
fundamentally at odds with these historical conventions of physical property
(mono-existentials) ownership. Such constructs have the inherent potential for unlimited
replicability and dissemination, and in the age of the Internet this potential is now
fully realized.</p><p>As a result the existing western Intellectual Property conventions are coming under
increasing stress, as the internal forces of replicability clash with the externally
constraining Intellectual Property framework. The Intellectual Property regime is also
coming under formal intellectual attack, as the dysfunctionality and true costs of this
regime become increasingly apparent.</p>

work against Proprietary-Haraam model and those
which are in harmony with the Libre-Halaal model –
and have identified a number of “tear points”. Our execution is
focused on these tear points.</p><p>Some of these tear points are more applicable to Eastern societies and some are more
applicable to Western societies.</p><p>We present and analyze these tear points with the goal of providing a cure
in the context of formulation of national
policies for Eastern societies and ad-hoc adoption amongst Westerners.</p>

<h3 id="sec169" class="subsection">10.2.1  Initial Focus: Digital Cures</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The domain of poly-existentials is vast. 
The digital domain in particular is an area where
we can explicitly focus on. In other words the initial scope of the cure is 
that of a “Digital Ecosystem”.</p><p>The Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem can not be fixed. Its dynamics are taking it to
a particular eventuality – destruction of civilization and humanity.</p><p>Instead we need to erect an alternative digital ecosystem to stand against it.</p><p>Software is a unique form of poly-existentials.
Software has the best chance of illustrating and correcting the Western IPR mistake
because it has the following attributes:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Software is practical and useful. It plays a pervasive role in our daily lives.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Software controls other digital entities and therefore it impacts internet services
and content.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Software development is highly collaborative in nature.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Software is inherently cumulative in nature.
</li></ul><p>For these reasons we believe that the software battle is the best
initial front against the proponents of the Western IP regime. Other
fields and professions –
pharmacists, physicians,
plant biologists, farmers, academics/students, and others –
can build on our efforts and mimic our approach.</p><p>In the realm of software and internet, we offer creation of the Libre-Halaal ByStar
digital ecosystem as a moral alternative to the Proprietary-Haraam American digital
ecosystem.</p><!--TOC subsection id="sec170" Inherently Collaborative vs Inhernetly Competitive-->

will function as part of informative cures.</p><p>Academic cures are the types of things that we all should do even when
we know that they wont amount to real cures. We call these academic,

prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you
access sites which are blocked.</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">FreedomBox</span><a id="hevea_default100"></a><span style="font-weight:bold"> Project:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>

chap:ProperGovernanceOfPoly-Existentials:HalaalAndHaraamMannerOfPoly-Existence –,
we emphasized the following:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
After rejecting the Western IPR regime, our focus should become 
the identification and definition of correct manner-of-existence of poly-existentials.
</li><li class="li-itemize">We then introduced the label of “Libre-Halaal” for the 
identification of correct manner-of-existence of poly-existentials.
</li><li class="li-itemize">We then provided our formal definition of “Libre-Halaal Software.”
</li><li class="li-itemize">Based on that definition we then provided a formal definition for 
“Libre-Halaal Internet Services.”
</li></ul><p>These definitions require perpetual internal transparency and
modify-ability of manner-of-existence of software towards two goals:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Global collaborative software and internet services development
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Guardianship of society by the software engineering profession 
</li></ol><p>In opposition to the Western IPR regime, there has been various attempts at 
creating global collaborative software and internet services development models.
But, the need for guardianship of society by the software engineering profession
has never been recognized in the West.</p><p>Free and open-source software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) is
software that is both free and open source. It is liberally licensed to grant users the
right to use, copy, study, change, and improve its design through the availability of its
source code. In the context of free and open-source software, free refers to the freedom
to copy and re-use the software, rather than to the price of the software.</p><p>The Western FOSS Movement has produced the GNU/Linux operating system and has demonstrated
the viability of free software as a development model for creating large-scale, complex,
relevant software systems. GNU/Linux is a fully viable free software alternative to the
proprietary Microsoft Windows operating system, against which it continues to make steady
inroads. Mozilla/Firefox is a fully viable alternative to the proprietary Microsoft
Internet Explorer, and is also experiencing steadily increasing usage. And apart from
such well-known and high-profile projects, behind the scenes the free software movement
has become a flourishing creative environment, generating a constant stream of new and
better software packages, duplicating and surpassing the capabilities of an
ever-increasing portion of proprietary software territory.</p><p>FOSS is rooted in Western values of liberty and individuality. Free software focuses on
the philosophical freedoms it gives to users, whereas open source software focuses on the
perceived strengths of its peer-to-peer development model. </p><p>The Free Software and Open Source movements and their combination the Free and open-source
software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) have been attempting to
address this labeling challenge. Because their philosophical and moral analysis is
shallow, all of their labels are problematic in a number of respects.</p><p>The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of IPR regime being just Western and does not
call for full abolishment of the IPR regime. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of the place of
software as a special form of digital poly-existential. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep
recognition of importance of morality and role of software engineering profession in
formulation of definitions and labels towards societal protection.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec177" Libre-Halaal Software versus Free Software-->
<h3 id="sec177" class="subsection">11.2.1  Libre-Halaal Software versus Free Software</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The defining criteria for free software are as follows. This is
reproduced from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</span></a>, current as
of July 2011.</p><p>
Free software is a matter of the users’ freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change
and improve the software. More precisely, it means that the program’s users have the
four essential freedoms:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
</li><li class="li-itemize">The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for
this.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
</li><li class="li-itemize">The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom
3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your
changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
</li></ul><p>A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms.
</p><p>This definition is consistent with our own definition of Halaal software. So why have we taken
the trouble to define Halaal software, when it turns out to be consistent with free software?</p><p>The reason is that the two definitions are ideologically different. They exist in
ideologically different contexts, and this ideological difference is reflected in their
phrasing.</p><p>The term “Free Software” was coined in the early 1980s in America.
Their culture and language lacked the word “Halaal”. So “Freedom” as the pinnacle of
American values became the key word. The label “Free Software” has proven problematic in
many respects. Free in English has two meanings, “gratis” and “liberty”. For the
public at large the “gratis” meaning is dominant, so the “Free Software” label never
worked well. To address this, the word “Libre” has been introduced into Globish and
“Free Software” and “Libre Software” have become synonyms. But, “Libre Software” is
also not a good label because it does not focus on the ethical, moral and societal manner
of existence of software. The focus of the label needs to be on morality and society. Once
“Halaal” is properly introduced into Globish [<a href="#PLPC-120039">7</a>], the label “Halaal
Software” will prove more crisp and more on the mark.</p><p>The free software definition exists in the context of Western copyright law, and
implicitly accepts that as a reality. The key to free software is the GPL (General Public
License), a form of licensing intended to preserve the four definitional freedoms. But
this is of course a form of copyright, and so the free software definition resides within
and submits to the Western copyright conventions.</p><p>The free software definition is rooted in the context of Western values and assumptions:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
It is centered on the individual (individual freedom), as opposed to being centered
on society (ethics and morality). The concepts of profession and society are absent. The
definition is based entirely on the individual, and the individual’s freedom.
</li><li class="li-itemize">It exists in the context of the Western Copyright and Patent regime. Freedom 2 and
freedom 3 are written in response to this, and implicitly accept this as a
reality. There is is no explicit assertion that the ability to copy is a natural law and
a human right.
</li><li class="li-itemize">It does not recognize the Software Engineering profession as a guardian. Freedom 1
makes no distinction between ordinary users (i.e. almost everyone), and software
engineering professionals. The implication is that anyone can exercise freedom 1,

<a id="chap:GlobalPoly-ExistentialCapitalism"></a>
</p><p>When there is one thing that can only be possessed by one possessor,
all wishing to possess that one thing must compete. Hence,
mono-existential capitalism is inherently competition oriented.</p><p>Thus far uses of the word capitalism have not been distinguishing
between mono-existential capitalism and poly-existential capitalism.
Economic models for mono-existentials and poly-existentials should be
inherently different. Because, mono-existentials lead to
mono-Possessablity and clear ownership rules but poly-existentials
lead to poly-Possessablity and no-ownership. Rivalry goods are rivalry
because of their mono-existence. Poly-existence naturally results in public
goods.</p><p>We are devout mono-existential bounded-corporations capitalists. </p><p>The existing capitalist model for mono-existentials is generally
correct, in both philosophical and economic terms. But the
extension of the mono-existential capitalist model into the
domain of poly-existentials, based on the Western IPR regime, is
a grave mistake. Philosophically it is wrong. Societally it is
harmful to humanity. And economically it is unstable and
vulnerable, since it can be displaced by disruptive business
models that are based on poly-existential dynamics.
We provide an example of this vulnerability in Section
<a href="#sec%3ACaseStudy%3ATheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystemOpenBusinessPlan">12.5</a> –
sec:CaseStudy:TheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystemOpenBusinessPlan.</p><p>Dynamics of mono-existential capitalism are generally well understood.
Americanism is rooted in mono-existential capitalism of unbounded-corporations.</p><p>The IPR model of creating artificial scarcity for poly-existentials 
so that mono-existential economic models remain intact is flawed
in the aggregate.</p><p>Possession and ownership of mono-existentials and poly-existentials
are inherently very different. Economic models that have been
established and have worked well in the realm of mono-existentials 
are not equally applicable to poly-existentials.
Basics of mono-existentials and poly-existentials are fundamentally
different and mono-existential capitalism and poly-existential
capitalism need to be fundamentally different. Unlike
mono-existentials that are inherently competition oriented,
poly-existential are inherently collaboration oriented.</p><p>A competing economic model that is in harmony with poly-existence can
easily overtake the IPR economic model. Eastern nations subscribing to
poly-existential capitalism can do a number to Western IPR based
economies.</p><p>The Western IPR based capitalist model has pushed for proprietary
activity in the for profit quadrant and non-proprietary activity in
the not-for profit quadrant. This too is artificial. Poly-existential
capitalism is about cultivation of the non-proprietary and for-profit
quadrant. We expand on this next.</p>

are not well established. The Venture Capitalist constituency does not
understand this quadrant, nor does it believe in it, nor does it have
any experience in it. </p><p>Business operation within the <em>non-proprietary, for-profit</em>
quadrant is still very unusual at this time, and mature business
models for this quadrant do not yet exist. Therefore our own Open
Business Plan may be considered the most complete business analysis of
the non-proprietary model in existence today.</p><p>The notion of a non-proprietary construct, residing and operating
within the for-profit sector, is new and different. Historically,
the for-profit sector has been closely associated with
proprietary ownership of assets. Hence the Internet Services
industry and the likes of Blackberry as we see them today. Also
historically, management of non-proprietary or public assets has
been primarily associated with the non-profit sector. Hence the
current orientation of the Free Software<a id="hevea_default107"></a>
Movement, operating largely within the non-profit sector.</p><p>We propose a radical shift of the Internet Services industry from the
for-profit, proprietary quadrant, to the for-profit, non-proprietary
quadrant. In this space the entire software for an Internet service
remains a communal public resource in the trust of the engineering
profession, while service deployment is driven forward by the full
force of for-profit commercial motivations.</p><p>This radical shift to the <em>non-proprietary, for-profit
quadrant</em>, causes a major industry reconfiguration, with
significant winners and losers. The losers are the existing
vested proprietary interests, whose economic hegemony
vanishes. But the winners are the many more companies who can now
enter the Libre-Halaal Software and Libre-Halaal Internet
Services market —and the end-users. The impact is immense both

<!--TOC section id="sec191" Transformation of Software into Services-->
<h2 id="sec191" class="section">12.2  Transformation of Software into Services</h2><!--SEC END --><p>To the above we now add another dimension. That of Software Vs Internet Services.</p><p>Part of the debate about free software is now over, while part
continues. The part that is over is any question about the viability
of free software as a development model for creating large-scale,
complex, relevant software systems. GNU/Linux is a fully viable free
software alternative to the proprietary Microsoft Windows operating
system, against which it continues to make steady inroads. Mozilla is
a fully viable alternative to the proprietary Microsoft Internet
Explorer, and is also experiencing steadily increasing usage. These
and numerous other free software projects—Apache, Qmail, Sendmail,
Bind, Plone, Snort and many others—have now become essential and
widely used components throughout the software and Internet
industries.</p><p>And apart from such well-known and high-profile projects, behind the
scenes the free software movement has become a flourishing creative
environment, generating a constant stream of new and better software
packages, duplicating and surpassing the capabilities of an
ever-increasing portion of proprietary software territory.</p><p>And the fundamental free software creative dynamic has now also become
very well understood: the free software development model allows <em>unrestricted creative reuse of existing assets at essentially zero
cost</em>. It is from this dynamic that the free software model derives
its tremendous generative power. Free software is thus fully
established as a generative engine and an industry reality, and is
here to stay.</p><p>But the part of the debate that continues is whether or not this has
any meaningful commercial dimension. Within the proprietary software
domain a powerful revenue-generating engine exists in the form of the
traditional software licensing model. But this revenue source is
absent under the free software model. In its place there are a number
of possible business and revenue models, but in all cases these lack
the large-scale repeatability that makes things really interesting
from a business perspective.</p><p>There thus remains a conceptual gap, a puzzle, about how the powerful
generative forces of free software can be turned into a large-scale,
repeatable, revenue stream. But this puzzle is now solved. And in this
business plan we present the solution.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec192" Business Dynamics Of Internet Services-->
<h3 id="sec192" class="subsection">12.2.1  Business Dynamics Of Internet Services</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Within the Internet
Services industry industry the business and revenue
models are quite clear and obvious. The largest and most obvious are
the subscription fee model of generalized service providers, and the advertising model of numerous specialized no-cost service
providers, demonstrated most spectacularly by Google. Both the
subscription fee and advertising models are unlimitedly scalable, thus
resulting in the gigantic commercial Internet of today.</p><p>But the Internet Services industry of today is a fundamentally
proprietary construct. While proprietary service providers can and do
make frequent use of free software components within their services,
they do not espouse the free software development model itself, and
their technical development process remains competitive and
proprietary. Though they may incorporate free software components, Facebook
and Google are certainly not free software.</p><div class="center">

</table></div>
<a id="fig:summaryFigure"></a>
<div class="center"><hr style="width:80%;height:2"></div></blockquote><p>Thus as we look at the software and Internet industries of today we
see two largely disjoint cultures. As illustrated in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AsummaryFigure">12.2</a> we see the free software domain, with its
powerful generative and propagative development model, but lacking any
clear large-scale monetization model. And separate from this we see
the proprietary Internet Services domain, with enormous revenue and
business consequences, but handicapped in scope and scale by its
competitive development model.</p><p>But now we are witnessing a further transformational event in the
evolution of the Internet: a shift of traditional software
applications towards a service-based implementation, or what is
sometimes called the “transformation of software into services.” And
this is the critical event that now solves the free software revenue
puzzle. This development unites the generative power of the free
software domain with the proven revenue models of the services domain.
The transformation of software into services <em>allows the powerful
generative model of free software to be invested directly into the
powerful revenue model of the Internet Services industry</em>.</p>

The Libre-Halaal
services are positioned in the For-Profit Non-Proprietary Quadrant For
Internet Services. Note that in the non-proprietary layer, re-use and
collaboration is far richer than the proprietary layer. For example,
in the Software slice, Debian and Ubuntu cross progress. In the
Services slice the same can happen. Where for example ByStar and
FreedomBox<a id="hevea_default108"></a> can cross progress. </p><p>The Libre-Halaal Services deployment model breaks both these traditions. It represents a
radical shift of the Internet Services industry from the for-profit, proprietary quadrant,
to the for-profit, non-proprietary quadrant. In this space the entire software for an
Internet service remains a communal public resource in the trust of the engineering

empowers the unbounded corporation to profit from the unbounded

step, we’ve managed to justify the operation of the Panopticon.”
</blockquote><p>The Panopticon is a architectural concept for a prison where the guards can watch, unseen
by the inmates, from a tower in the middle into all cells build in a circle around the
tower. It leaves the inmates in a perceived state of permanent surveillance. The French
philosopher Michel Foucault described the effect:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Hence the major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and
permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power. So to arrange things
that the surveillance is permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its
action; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual exercise
unnecessary; that this architectural apparatus should be a machine for creating and
sustaining a power relation independent of the person who exercises it; in short, that the
inmates should be caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the bearers.
</blockquote><p>The original Panopticon, like the digital versions the likes of NSA and Microsoft are
building, takes away all feeling of privacy. Even when one is not watched, knowing that
the possibility of being watched is always there, creates uncertainty and leads to self
disciplining and self censorship. It is certainly a state the powers that be would like
everyone, except themselves, to be in.</p><p>To call these signs of deterioration of humanity is an understatement.</p>

related and dependent on these companies. If bread and butter of these companies was to
become profiting from crushing autonomy and privacy of the individual, most of their
employees would likely not have any interest in facing an honest mirror. That has already
happened.</p><p>People are naturally good at justifying the morality of their
self-interest in a variety of forms. Mass psychology then kicks in and
reinforces short term interests towards global mass exploitation.
It is an inherent characteristic of citizens of unchecked powers to confuse
morality with self-interest. Consider America and Americans.</p><p>From the perspective of a drug dealer, use of drugs is no problem. Many drug pushers are
drug users. They want every body to be using drugs. After all, it is a profitable
business and economics is the basis of everything. When someone tells them that subjecting
cocaine to business and economics is wrong, the drug dealer does not
have the ear for it.</p><p>Individual’s autonomy and privacy are not market commodities. They are part of humanity.
The problem that we are pointing to is a human problem. This could well not be a problem for
economic creatures existing in an industrial context — that is how pure raw
American capitalism is viewed by many.</p><p>This sort of thing happens gradually. People become accustomed to the problem. They become
dependent on the problem. They become the problem. The next generation is born into it.
And then there is no problem.</p><p>Everybody does it. Everybody is on Facebook. What problem?</p><p>The public at large, and the young in particular, follows and is manipulated. They sit in
awe of Internet technology. Ignorant, they trust the specialists who are there to milk
their soul. The latest gadget and the latest Internet feature includes exploitation of
another aspect of their privacy. They feel in charge while being used. And they feel
empowered. </p><p>The concept that these very same awesome capabilities and technology can exist in
a healthy context is foreign to the public at large. Industrial tools is all that they
have seen, Tools for Conviviality, [<a href="#PLPC-120037">3</a>], is Greek to them.</p><p>Others kind of see the problem but consider it inevitable. More recently, discussions of
loss of privacy in the context of Internet services has become a daily occurrence in
mainstream western press. None of these discussions has any depth and no meaningful cure
is even searched for. Many articles and books have been written about “End of Privacy.”
Shallow, subdued nagging – that is the position and role of American press on the problem. </p>

</p><p>The broad label that we use for Internet services and software as it
exists and is practiced today, is: “The Proprietary American Digital
Ecosystem”. We include the term American in this label not just
because it is dominated by America, but because it is rooted in
American values and American rules. The American purely economic
model and widespread practices which are based on Western IPR regime
has led to dominance of Internet by large American corporation and
governance of the Internet through Corpocracy. These corrupt values
and models are now being exported and forced on the rest of the world
in the name of Internet.</p><p>The manner by which the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem is shaped by American
societal norms is multi-faceted. To better understand this, in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AproprietaryDeLayers">13.2</a> we provide a layered model.</p><div class="center">

<a href="#TheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystem">14.2</a>. Note that without recognizing and tackling the underlying
root causes of the problems that the proprietary American digital ecosystem present, it is
not possible to cure these problems. When the underlying nature of any public digital
ecosystem is proprietary, it poses a danger to health of society.</p><p>In the following sections, we focus on specific aspects of the above layered model.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec203" Competing Proprietary Digital Enclaves-->
<h3 id="sec203" class="subsection">13.3.1  Competing Proprietary Digital Enclaves</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem comprises of a number of competing Proprietary
Digital Enclaves. The proprietary Microsoft digital enclave is one such example. The
Microsoft enclave has had its roots in the proprietary software business and is now trying
to bring in proprietary services. The proprietary Google digital enclave is an other
example. The Google enclave has had its roots in the proprietary search business and is
now trying to integrate with more software and services. Apple, Facebook and Amazon are
examples of other American Digital Enclaves. What they all have in common is that they are
all competing locked environment driven by Patent and Copyright laws. None of these
enclaves were designed ab-initio to be digital environments for humanity. All of these
enclaves exist primarily to generate profit for their owners.</p><p>This model of being governed by competing proprietary enclaves is normal and even desired
by most Americans. The American medical system is similarly structured and so is the
American food system.
From the outside, many view Americans
as purely economic creatures that exist in an industrial context who are fully committed
to supremacy of money. While the proprietary American digital ecosystem my be fine for
Americans, it may not be for the rest of the world. Bits are without border and this
American disease 
has been spreading.</p><p>Ramifications of manner-of-existence of the proprietary digital
ecosystem, matters in two important ways. It matters in terms of
service functionality—what the service itself is actually doing. And
it matters in terms of policy—what the service provider is doing.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec204" Ramifications On Service Functionality-->
<h3 id="sec204" class="subsection">13.3.2  Ramifications On Service Functionality</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Regarding service functionality: existing proprietary services such as
Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and virtually
every other service—these are strictly controlled assets of their
owning companies, heavily defended by patents and copyright. The software
that runs the service is closed, such that the true service
functionality is unknown. This means that the user of the
service you have no knowledge of what the service is actually doing
behind the scenes. For example, you have no knowledge of what the
service is doing with your personal information. Every item of
information you provide to the service, either implicitly or
explicitly—every communication, every search query, every website
visited, every mouse click—can be used by the service provider for
unknown purposes, without your knowledge or consent.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec205" Ramifications On Service Policy-->
<h3 id="sec205" class="subsection">13.3.3  Ramifications On Service Policy</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Regarding policy: in principle, the service provider’s actions are constrained by the
Service Agreement (Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, etc.) between the provider and
user. However, these agreements are drafted by the provider’s corporate lawyers, consist
of sophisticated legalese that few users read, and are heavily biased towards the
interests of the provider. In particular, they are drafted without any formal
representation or advocacy for the interests of the user.</p><p>Proprietary services are operated by corporations whose actions are driven purely by
profit. This is the single ultimate purpose of the proprietary service provider, to which
all other considerations come secondary. In particular, both functionality and policy are
dictated wholly by this purpose, with no concession towards the interests of the
individual user or the general public welfare, beyond what contributes directly or
indirectly to profit.</p><p>This closed, profit-motivated and -dominated Internet services model represents severe
endangerment to critical civil liberties such as privacy, freedom of information, and
freedom of speech.</p><p>The existing proprietary regime leads to the wrong manner-of-existence for software and the
wrong model for provision of Internet services. Wrong in that it allows control of the
service by the provider, and exploitation of the user’s data, in a way that is detrimental
and unknown to the user. The solution to this is an entirely different model for Internet
services, where service ownership is placed squarely in the public domain.</p>

</p><p>Dear Fellow World Citizen,</p><p>In the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem (Internet Application
Services as they exist today), the individual’s autonomy and privacy
are being crushed. A deal has been made. Users free-of-charge
get: email, calendar, address book, content publication, and Facebook
friends. In return, American corporations get: semantic analysis of
email, spying with consent, traffic, logs and trail analysis and
behavior cross referencing. </p><p>A new currency has been created. The user’s autonomy and
privacy is now the implicit Internet currency. 
For now, the established business model is
that of translation of the individual’s privacy into targeted
advertising. That business model will naturally grow in scope.
The debit side of this new currency is civilization and humanity. </p><p>Today, the world is largely unaware of this. The public is completely
oblivious to the perils of the proprietary Internet model, and happily
entrusts its personal data, its privacy, its freedoms and its civil
liberties to proprietary business interests. And the people whose
responsibility it is to safeguard the public interest – government,
and the engineering profession – are asleep at the wheel. Or worse yet,
they have become accomplices.</p><p>In addition, Internet services are inconsistent, disparate and incoherent.
Resulting into 10s of passwords for the individual on services over
which she has no real control. The dynamics and trends of the
Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem are such that autonomy and
privacy of the individual will continue to deteriorate.</p><p>This is about rescuing humanity from the dragnet of Google, Facebook and America’s
surveillance economy. <span style="font-weight:bold">Our primary offerings are real, tangible and practical
autonomy and privacy – on very large scale.</span></p><p>We are Internet Engineers. We know that we can design and create a
complete parallel digital ecosystem which preserves the individual’s
autonomy and privacy – to compete with and stand against
the existing Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem. And
we have done so.</p><p>But to put it in its intended widespread usage, we also need your participation (our
fellow engineers, journalists, financiers, academics, government representatives,
ethicists and users). Preservation of autonomy and privacy are multi-dimensional. So, we
have taken it upon ourselves to also consider philosophical, moral, societal, social,
economic and business dimensions of our parallel digital ecosystem.</p><p>The umbrella title that we have chosen for our work is:</p><blockquote class="quote">
<span style="font-weight:bold">The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem</span><br>
 <span style="font-weight:bold">A Unified and Non-Proprietary Model For Autonomous Internet Services</span><br>
 <span style="font-weight:bold">A Moral Alternative To The Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem</span><br>

</blockquote><p>ByStar (By* – pronounced by-star) is based on the model of Federations of Autonomous
Libre-Halaal Services and is being presented as a moral alternative to the American
Proprietary Digital Ecosystem.</p><p>The totality of Libre-Halaal software, Libre-Halaal Internet services,
content generation and publication facilities and societal
frameworks that we describe are designed for preservation of ByStar
user’s autonomy, privacy and freedom. 
The health of society is our objective.
This is not about rejection or prohibition or censorship of Internet. This is about
creation of a parallel digital ecosystem within the Internet based on values which are 
very different from the economically driven proprietary American digital ecosystem.</p><p>By “Digital Ecosystem”, we mean the whole thing, including
inter-related software, systems, services, content and
societal frameworks. The integrated facilities of ByStar are intended
to be used by a very large segment of population on this planet. The
scope of these integrated offerings is vast – paralleling most of
what exists in the proprietary Internet today.</p><p>The parallels include:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
A functional equivalent of Gmail that recognizes your mailbox must be autonomous and private.
</li><li class="li-itemize">A functional equivalent of Facebook that is based on facilitation of end-to-end private interactions.
</li><li class="li-itemize">A functional equivalent of YouTube that recognizes your content as yours.
</li><li class="li-itemize">A functional equivalent of Windows that creates a deep Software-Service continuum.
</li></ul><p>In the ByStar model these capabilities are
unified, consistent and coherent.</p><p>This is not about any new particular functionality.
It is not a faster, cheaper, better story.
In terms of functionality, what we offer is generally same as what exists today. Our
model provides for the existing functionalities, while offering tangible autonomy and
tangible privacy.</p><p>The ByStar model empowers the user herself, to be her own
Application Service Provider (ASP). This model of “Be Your Own
ASP”, is based on comprehensive Libre-Halaal software and a
cohesive infrastructure that any user can choose to fully host her own
cloud services (Do It Yourself ByStar), or use pre-made
autonomous cloud services (We Do It For You ByStar).</p><p>There is nothing anti-business about our offerings and our moral stands. The ByStar
business model is simply different from the current dominant American business models of
exploiting privacy and autonomy. We are in the business of providing autonomy and privacy.
And there is plenty of money in that.
Broad and deep usage of our software and our Internet application services will create
revenue opportunities that are similar to those of large Internet application service
providers today. These revenues include subscriber fees, advertising, customization
consultation, general consultation and interaction facilitation fees. Profit, business
and economics are an integral part of ByStar.</p><p>Key distinguishing aspects of our approach and software and services
are:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Preservation of the individual’s autonomy. ByStar services are inherently
autonomous. They belong to each and every one of their owner-users – not the service
provider.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Preservation of the individual’s privacy.
The individual is in full control of her service.
She can fully control her privacy.
</li><li class="li-itemize">They are comprehensive, unified, consistent and cohesive.
The scope of ByStar is everything. The “*” in By* comes from the
glob expansion symbol. And all these services are unified with the
ByStarEntity model.
</li><li class="li-itemize">They are rooted in the correct manner-of-existence of software and services. The
entirety of ByStar software and services are internally transparent. ByStar software
and services development process is fully collaborative. Based on the nature of
poly-existentials, ByStar ideology fully rejects the Western Intellectual Proprietary
Rights regime.
</li></ul><p>In other words,
morality, health of society, and well being of
humanity are an integral part of 
software and services that we offer.
This work is primarily not Businessman driven. It is
Engineer driven.
</p><p>We believe that privacy, autonomy and freedom aspects of the Digital Ecosystem that we are
creating are important enough to “convert” many existing proprietary service users to
become Libre-Halaal ByStar users. All attempts at claiming autonomy and privacy in the
proprietary model are hollow at most. It is not possible to offer real and tangible
autonomy and privacy without committing to complete internal transparency of software and
services. The proprietary model leads to dark software and dark services (internally
opaque) which are inherently anti-autonomy and anti-privacy.</p><p>Such a large undertaking by such a small group should normally amount
to not much more than pipe dreams. Typical first reaction to our
claim is a chuckle. Some say it is insane. Many say that the notion
of creating a parallel digital ecosystem is so very lofty that
it can’t be realistic. </p><p>There are several reasons why we believe widespread usage of what we
are building is more than plausible. It is viable and likely. </p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
ByStar ideology is in harmony with nature.
We understand the enormous, seismic force that accompanies 
<a href="http://www.halaalsoftware.org">halaal manner-of-existence of software</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.libreservices.org">halaal manner-of-existence of Internet services</a>
(as expressed in the
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/PLPC/120039">Libre-Halaal label</a>).
Manifestations of this force include
the Free Software Movement and GNU/Linux. But there is far more to come.</li><li class="li-enumerate">We have already built the needed framework and starting points. 
These are in place and are growing.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">The ByStar model grand design is broad, evolutionary, expandable
and it can grow to scale to planet wide usage.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">The demand for autonomy and privacy are very real.
Many are starting to recognize that things
like Facebook are very wrong. Healthy alternatives are craved. </li><li class="li-enumerate">The business and economic models for ByStar have been thought
through and are being cultivated.
</li></ol><p>There are two fundamental concepts at the core of what we are presenting and offering:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Humans are more than just economic creatures. Internet’s model can not be based on pure economics.</li><li class="li-enumerate">The Western Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime is
a colossal mistake – Western IPR laws are in conflict with nature and detrimental to civilization.</li></ol><p>If you are unable or unwilling to explore the truth behind these basic
concepts, 
then ByStar is likely not for you. 
</p><p>If you recognize the critical distinction between humans and economic creatures,
and if you recognize the basic human need for autonomy and privacy, 
and if you are willing to explore the rejection of the Western IPR regime, then the
Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem could well be for you.</p><p>-180016</p><p>-180016</p><p>-180016</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec209" Root Causes Of The Problem-->
<h3 id="sec209" class="subsection">14.1.1  Root Causes Of The Problem</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The Internet has its origins in America. In the beginning, the Internet was a healthy
Engineering construct – and we played a minor role in its formation. The initial model of
the Internet was rooted in the end-to-end model of interactions between autonomous
entities/individuals, but things changed quickly. The Internet became a business
construct. Now, the current basic model of Internet is rooted in the rise-of-the-middle
model of corporations exploiting the individual.</p><p>Today’s Internet has been shaped by Proprietary American values.
And this is the root cause of the problem.</p><p>
We describe this in Section

<a id="TheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystem"></a></p><p>The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem model is fundamentally
different in every respect.</p><p>In terms of ownership, there is no ownership: Libre-Halaal Services in software form are a
communal public resource, with no patent, copyright or secrecy barriers to free access and
usage by anyone.</p><p>In terms of functionality, the software is open, so the services are completely
transparent in operation. This transparency allows professional oversight by the
engineering community, to verify the integrity of the service, ensuring that it in no way
violates the interests of the user or the general public welfare.</p><p>And in terms of policy, operation of the service is governed by a social contract, drafted
with full representation and advocacy for the individual user and the general public
welfare.</p><p>The Libre model thus fully guarantees the critical civil liberties that are endangered
under the proprietary model.</p><p>By* Federation of Autonomous Libre Services are Internet
Application Services that are internally transparent and focus on
preservation of user’s privacy and autonomy. By* stands against
Facebook/Google/Yahoo/MSN/iCloud the same way that Linux stands against
Microsoft Windows.</p><p>This is very different from existing Internet services capabilities. The Internet landscape
of today has arisen in a highly disorganized, unstructured way, driven by a multitude of
uncoordinated commercial ventures. The existing services capabilities have been built in a
completely ad hoc manner, based on immediate business expedience, rather than any sort of
coherent design. The result is the Internet Services industry as it appears today: a
multiplicity of functionally isolated, incompatible services. And while this may not be
apparent to the everyday user, having never experienced anything different, this limits
the capabilities of Internet services in many ways.</p><p>By* is the model for a new generation of unified Internet services, far superior to the
uncoordinated mishmash of services that exists today. It is designed for consistent,
uniform interoperability across all types and manners of service usage. By* is the
Internet services industry, done right.</p><p>We now present an overview of our work and the contours of ByStar
in 4 regards – Ideology, Model, Capabilities and Economics.</p>

digital ecosystems are laws and models governing poly-existentials (knowledge, ideas,
information, the digital entities). Societal Agreements governing all that is digital (and
more broadly poly-existential) in the West is based on the IP regime. This has shaped the
entirety of Western Digital Ecosystems.</p><p>In contrast, ByStar is ab-initio driven by the ideology that morality and health of
society should be the foundation of the ByStar digital ecosystem. The fundamental
difference between ByStar ideology and the Proprietary American ideology is that in ByStar
priorities, society/humanity comes first and profit/economics come second.
In the Proprietary American priorities profit/economics comes first and above all else.</p><p>
In Figure <a href="#fig%3AbxIdeologyDocs">14.1</a>, we present a roadmap in forms of
layers. Each layer has a document that addresses that concept. Each layer
builds on the layers below. At the lowest layer lies moral and
societal questions of right and wrong (halaal and haraam).
</p><p>The two green layers at the bottom are philosophical, moral and societal. Their scope is wider
than the moral digital ecosystem that we are after. Generally speaking, they are not the
domain of engineers. They are the domain of ethicists, philosophers and sociologists.</p><p>The blue layers are philosophical, moral, societal, social and engineering aspects of
digital ecosystems that require direct involvement of engineers.</p><p>-180016</p>

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec213" The ByStar Reference Model-->
<h4 id="sec213" class="subsubsection">The ByStar Reference Model</h4><!--SEC END --><p>ByStar is based on a set of key abstractions, representing the major
real-world entities that must be represented within a generalized web
structure. These entities include such things as individual persons,
businesses, physical locations, and events. For each such entity we
have defined the structures and conventions required to represent,
instantiate and name that entity in a unified, consistent way, and at a
very large scale. We have then defined the major classes of services
required to manage these entities, and to allow highly generalized
interactions within and among each other.</p><p>In the ByStar applied model, a real-world entity type (for example
individuals or a physical locations) maps on to
a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntityType</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntityType</span>). 
A real-world entity instance maps on to a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntity</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span>)
All ByStar services are anchored in <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntity</span>.</p><p>ByStarEntityTypes are structured hierarchically in a tree.</p><p><span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntityType</span> is either a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarAutonomousEntityType</span>
or a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarControlledEntityType</span>. </p><p><span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarAutonomousEntityType</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarControlledEntityType</span> are either

</pre><p>All ByStarEntityIds are unique. The <span style="font-family:monospace">InstanceId</span> is assigned by the <span style="font-family:monospace">RegistrarId</span>.</p><p>Each <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> can be activated within a

The representation of a

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec214" Domain Name Bindings Of ByStarEntity-->
<h4 id="sec214" class="subsubsection">Domain Name Bindings Of ByStarEntity</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Each <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntity</span> consists of specific information and a set of computing and
communication services.</p><p>Publicly, <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> is usually exposed throughout Internet at a 
selected DNS domain name. In the ByStar model, binding of a <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> to
one or more domain names is designed to be very flexible. This flexibility relates to
Service Portability, but is broader. These notions are absent or very rare in the
Proprietary American model.</p><p>For instance, in the context of the examples described in Section
<a href="#ByStarEntityRealizationExamples">14.3</a>, Bob Smith is assigned BxEntityId=23.1.2.7.3.32674
which is canonically bound to the base domain name <span style="font-family:monospace">5.bob.smith.byname.net</span>.</p><p>ByStar permits Bob Smith to bind his BxEntity to other domain names, for example
bobsmith.fr. In the ByStar BySMB service this is common place. Often, with the
anticipation of obtaining example.com, example.bysmb.com and its BxEntity can be
pre-generated. The owner, can re-adjust the binding of BxEntity to a chosen domain name 
at will.</p><p>Different information, different capabilities and different features of a
<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> are usually bound to different domain names within a base
domain name hierarchy.</p><p>For example, Bob’s imap service is at <span style="font-family:monospace">imap.5.bob.smith.byname.net</span>, his genealogy
service is at <span style="font-family:monospace">geneweb.5.bob.smith.byname.net</span> and his synchronization repository
(version control – vc) is at <span style="font-family:monospace">vc.5.bob.smith.byname.net</span>.</p><p>In cases where the owner asserts autonomy by possession of the service as a
<span style="font-family:monospace">BxAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</span>, ByStar provides the ability to selectively DNS
resolve BxEntity domains locally. This, then also permits fully local (non-networked)
development and access to BxEntity – based on existing DNS bindings.</p><p>These flexible ByStar domain name to BxEntity bindings, and flexible DNS resolutions, are
built on top of djbdns.</p>

<div class="center"><hr style="width:80%;height:2"></div></blockquote><p>Internet services come in all shapes and sizes, serve all manner of purposes, and interact
with each other and with societal entities in all manner of complex ways.</p><p>In some cases a service may be associated exclusively with a particular societal entity,
such as an individual, an organization, or a corporation. Such entities enjoy a high
degree of autonomy within society, and so we refer to these as autonomous entities. When a
service is associated uniquely with particular autonomous entity, we refer to the entity
as the owner of the service.</p><p>When a service is associated with a unique “owner”, certain characteristics of the service
are of particular concern to the owner. The service may include information of a personal
or private nature, and the owner may wish to ensure that his/her/its privacy is
protected. It is also important that the service reflect and maintain the autonomy of the
owner, providing parallel freedom of action to that which the owning entity enjoys at
large.</p><p>Certainly, the privacy and autonomy of the owner are fully guaranteed if the owner
exercises direct control over the functioning and provision of the service. In practice,
an owner may or may not choose to exercise such direct control of the service. In many
cases the owner of the service will leave the service provisioning in the hands of a
second-party service provider. Nevertheless it is sufficient to guarantee the autonomy of
the owner if the nature of the service is such that the owner could in principle take
control of the service himself.</p><p>We define an <span style="font-weight:bold">autonomous libre-halaal service</span> as an Internet service associated with a
unique owner, that the owner could in principle and at his option take control over and
provide for himself.</p><p>ByStar services are structured in two layers.
(1) ByStar Autonomous Services and (2) ByStar Federated Services.</p><p>Any ByStar Autonomous Service may also include ByStar Controlled Services.</p><p>As noted, in many or most cases the service will be provided by a second-party service
provider, who runs and administers the service on behalf of the owner. The autonomy of the
owner requires that he is in no way tied to this or any other service provider. The
general societal autonomy of the owner means that for any other type of service—banking,
legal, medical—the owner is free to move from one provider to another, leaving no trace
of himself behind with the previous provider.</p><p>In the case of Internet services, similar principles apply. For a service to be an
autonomous halaal service, it must satisfy the twin requirements of <span style="font-weight:bold">portability</span>,
and <span style="font-weight:bold">non-retention</span>. Portability, meaning the owner can transport the entire service
to a different service provider. And non-retention, meaning the previous provider must
retain no trace of the owner’s information.</p><p>Specifically, when a second-party provider is providing the service on behalf of the
owner, the service is an autonomous halaal service if the provider meets the following
requirements:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Service and Data Portability</span>. At the instruction of the service owner, the
entire service can be transferred to a different service provider. This could be another
second-party provider, or the service owner himself.
</li><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Service and Data Non-Retention</span>. At the instruction of the service owner,
the service provider must destroy all service-related information (i.e. all owner data
and log files).
</li></ol>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec216" ByStar Controlled Services – Internet Of Things-->
<h4 id="sec216" class="subsubsection">ByStar Controlled Services – Internet Of Things</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Any ByStar Autonomous Service may control certain “ByStar Controlled Services” 
that are his.</p><p>A ByStar Controlled Service is a ByStarEntity which is in control of
ByStarAutonomousEntity.</p><p>As an example consider an individual (say the author –
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span></a>) who hypothetically owns 
a house, a bicycle, a Nike fuel band and a tag for his suitcase.</p><p>Virtual representation of these could be:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
A House – <a href="http://info.1-98008-5807-10.bywhere.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://info.1-98008-5807-10.bywhere.net</span></a> – where ByWhere structure
links control to its owner (a ByStarAutonomousEntity).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A Bicycle – whose location information goes to it owner (a
ByStarAutonomousEntity) and not Google-corporation.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A Nike Fuel Band – which send the exercise information to its owner-individual
(not Nike-corporation).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A tag for his suitcase – which links to it owner (a ByStarAutonomousEntity).
</li></ol><p>Each of these as a ByStarControlledEntity will be controlled by the
ByStarAutonomousEntity. All of these are 
ByStarEntity-s. The ones that are controlled, link to their controller.
The ByStarAutonomousEntity has links to all the
ByStarControlledEntity-s that it controls.</p><p>So, we now have a framework for abstracting individuals as
owners/controllers through ByStarAutonomousEntity. And we have
abstractions for things to be owned and controlled through
ByStarControlledEntity. And we have a framework for interaction
of individuals/things and things/individuals through ByStar Federated
Services.</p><p>Now, compare the model of ownership and interactions of Things in
Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem – which is anchored in the
autonomous individual – with the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem
– which is anchored in the Proprietary Corporation. There the
proprietary internet service provider controls individuals also through
Things.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec217" ByStar Federated Services-->
<h4 id="sec217" class="subsubsection">ByStar Federated Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Autonomous services and their controlled services may wish to engage in end-to-end
interactions with other autonomous services. But in order to facilitate such interactions,
involvement of some intermediary services may be needed.</p><p>We refer to such enabling intermediary services as <span style="font-weight:bold">federated
services</span>, and we refer to the association of a federated service
plus its subscribing autonomous services as a <span style="font-weight:bold">federation of
autonomous services</span>.</p><p>The concept of Federated Services is layered above Autonomous Services and
focuses on interactions amongst Autonomous Services and facilitation of information
aggregation amongst ByStar Services.</p><p>An example of a federated service for information aggregation is
ByTopic.org where autonomously published content
(documents/music/video) is optionally centrally republished –
autonomous and federated publication are fully consistent.</p>

the traditional browser based model, ByStar provides for rich and deep
Software-Service integration.</p><p>Initially we are focusing on two convivial, [<a href="#PLPC-120044">6</a>], User Environments for ByStar.</p><p>Blee (ByStar Libre Emacs Environment) is a layer above Emacs and Firefox that

<a id="sec:ToolsForConviviality"></a>
</p><p>Our primary criteria for software component selection and service design is
“conviviality”.</p><p>By conviviality we refer to the concept of 
“Tools for Conviviality” as Ivan Illich
introduced it. </p><p>In the document titled:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Introducing Convivial Into Globish</span><br>
 <a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120044">http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120044</a>
</blockquote><p>
we introduce the concept of "Convivial" into Globish.</p><p>Briefly, in Illich’s words:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates
himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he
actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon.<p>To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world
with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools,
the shape of the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial
tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest
opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or
her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who
use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning
and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a
convivial fashion.
</p></blockquote><p>The dynamics of the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem are such
that they produce industrial tools.</p><p>The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem is designed to fully reside in the 
Libre-Halaal-Convivial quadrant, [<a href="#PLPC-180044">10</a>]. </p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec222" ByStar End-To-End Philosophy – vs Rise of the Middle-->
<h4 id="sec222" class="subsubsection">ByStar End-To-End Philosophy – vs Rise of the Middle</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The dominant model of interaction between people and the model of access to
information in the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem is the
centrally controlled <a id="hevea_default115"></a>Rise-of-the-Middle model – which puts the service
provider at the center of all interactions so that it can exploit users
and traffic information. </p><p>The ByStar model, in contrast, is end-to-end oriented and is based on the
following principles:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Make Services Autonomous Whenever Possible (peer-to-peer oriented)
</li><li class="li-itemize">Invest and Focus on End-to-End communications facilities amongst
Autonomous Libre Services
</li><li class="li-itemize">When a Federated Service functions as an intermediary, limit its role to the bare
essential of hooking the two ends. Thereafter, communications can be end-to-end.
</li></ul>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec223" Choice Of Software Components-->
<h4 id="sec223" class="subsubsection">Choice Of Software Components</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The Libre-Halaal software model is a flourishing creative environment,
generating a constant stream of new and better software packages,
duplicating and surpassing the capabilities of an ever-increasing
portion of proprietary software territory. Indeed for any particular
item of functionality, there are typically multiple alternative free
software packages available.</p><p>In this environment the model for implementation of By* service
functionality is not one of original software development. Rather it
is a process of intelligent selection and integration of functional
components from the Libre-Halaal software creative environment.</p><p>So in creating By* our task has not been to write functional software
components—in fact we have written almost none. Our main task has
been to make careful engineering choices among the available free
software components, and integrate these properly into the By*
framework. In making these choices we consider not just the features
and capabilities of each software component, but also the
compatibility of the component within the overall By* architecture.</p><p>The main considerations in our choice of software components have been:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Conviviality</li><li class="li-itemize">Scalability</li><li class="li-itemize">Libre-Halaal Mainstreamness</li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar Consistency</li></ul><p>Virtually all the initial By* service functionality has been created
this way. The following are some of the basic By* features that have
been included by this process:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Debian GNU/Linux.</li><li class="li-itemize">Base: djbdns, daemontools, ucspi, multilog, ... </li><li class="li-itemize">Mail: qmail, courier, spamassassin, ezmlm, ... </li><li class="li-itemize">Web: apache, zope, plone, geneweb, squirellmail, jquerymobile, galleria, ... </li></ul><p>We will continue to select and incorporate additional software
packages as these materialize within the free software environment. We
will not create, so much as we will harvest. Or to paraphrase the
common industry dictum: <em>Good programmers write good software; great
programmers reuse and integrate</em>.</p><p>This is the extraordinary power, and magic, of free software: the
ability to take things and reuse them at extremely low cost. This is
what has allowed a small consulting company in Bellevue to create the
beginnings of something that can eventually displace MSN and Google.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec224" Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy-->
<h4 id="sec224" class="subsubsection">Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy</h4><!--SEC END --><p>By confidentiality we mean: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</p><p>By anonymity we mean: the characteristic of any interaction where an individual protects
his or her identity from being shared with another person or with a third party in the
context of particular communications.</p><p>By privacy we mean: the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively. </p><p>ByStar Autonomous Services are designed to provide tangible confidentiality, anonymity and
privacy on large scale. All of Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem has this inherent design.</p><p>The basic assumption in the ByStar Digital Ecosystem is that all communications and
traffic is subject to eavesdropping and traffic analysis. </p><p>Fortunately, the nature of digital information is such that it is easier to encrypt 
than it is to decrypt.</p><p>With nature on our side, ByStar Digital Ecosystem provides large scale countermeasures
which include end-to-end data confidentiality and traffic flow confidentiality.</p><p>ByStar federated services are governed by transparency and well understood logging
expectations and audit trail protections which are oriented towards preservation of
privacy.</p><p>All of this is in stark contrast to how confidentiality, anonymity and privacy are in the
American Proprietary Digital Ecosystem. There, they have become a currency.</p>

growing. 
Basic structures of ByStar is in place and many services
are built or are partially built. The Libre-Halaal Services collaborative
framework allows for ByStar to grow dynamically.</p><p>Thus far our focus has been in making sure that the overall architecture of the ByStar
Digital Ecosystem is sound. We have been designing big and implementing gradually.
A complete stable system is in place. It is now a matter of expanding and improving it.</p><p>In ByStar, today for email, we don’t use gmail, yahoo, msn, outlook.com, aol or other
proprietary centrally controlled mail services. We use BystarMail. Similarly, for web
presence, content publication, photo and video galleries ByStar has existing capabilities.</p><p>Here we provide a summary of where ByStar services stand
today.</p><p>A snap shot of the organizations, services and software that form the
ByStar Digital Ecosystem today are shown in Figure <a href="#fig%3ALS-Assets">14.5</a>.</p><p>Free Protocols Foundation central resources are shown in violet in <a href="#fig%3ALS-Assets">14.5</a>.
Neda resources are shown in yellow.
Current ByStarEntity generators are shown under the “ByStar
Autonomous” label and ByStar federated services are shown next to
them. ByStar software consists of three major layers, these are shown in blue.</p><p>The current status and growth of of ByStar falls into four broad
categories:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Current Capabilities of ByStarEntity (ByStarServiceObject) –
what any autonomous services is capable of offering.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Current Span of ByStarEntity Generators – What type of autonomous

supported?
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Current Scope of ByStar Federated Services.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Scale of User Base – how many people are using ByStar?

Current ByStarEntity Generators are shown in Figure <a href="#fig%3ALS-Assets">14.5</a>

Current Federated Services are shown in Figure

information aggregation. These include ByTopic, ByContent and BySearch.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec237" Growth of user base: timing-->
<h4 id="sec237" class="subsubsection">Growth of user base: timing</h4><!--SEC END --><p>An important consideration is the point at which we will begin to accept
the burden of significant numbers of users. </p><p>In the case of a conventional service deployment there is typically a
major emphasis placed on early and rapid growth of user base, to
demonstrate demand and marketplace viability of the service, and lay
claim to a particular portion of functional territory. This was modus
operandi during the dot con era, where claims of user base numbers
were an integral part of spin-and-flip and pump-and-dump model. Some
of those attitudes still persist.</p><p>However we are not following this standard early proof-of-service
approach. This may be appropriate for a conventional new service,
where service functionality is the central and most critical issue.
But for ByStar, a different timing strategy is
required.</p><p>First, as a superset of numerous existing services, proof of service
for By* in functional terms is already demonstrated by the Internet
Services industry as it exists today. It is far more important to
prove the model itself rather than its functional manifestations, and
hasty creation of user base does little to accomplish this.</p><p>Instead we have provided a coherent and complete description of the
model in this and our other documents. The theoretical basis for the
model is solid, and this will be clear to anyone willing to invest the
time to understand it. In addition a number of working By*
implementations are already in place; examples are provided.
Though the scale of usage remains small,
these are sufficient to demonstrate the viability of the Libre-Halaal model
and the ByStar design, and the value of the resulting services to paying
clients.</p><p>But a far more important consideration is that installed base is very
costly in terms of maintenance and support, and premature exposure to
these costs can jeopardize the more critical work of building the
underlying model machinery. Therefore we will not take on the burden
of user base until the time and/or context is right for this. This
means either that we are fully ready to accept the associated costs of
ownership, or that the user base is being taken on in an appropriate
context, such as a suitable business partnership.</p><p>Under either scenario our strategy is the same: at the right time we
will populate the services at large scale by mass creation of By*
service accounts for large existing user bases, [<a href="#PLPC-110005">19</a>].</p><div class="center">

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec240" Relationship With FOSS / FLOSS / FreedomBox Movements-->
<h4 id="sec240" class="subsubsection">Relationship With FOSS / FLOSS / FreedomBox Movements</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Free and open-source software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source
software (FLOSS) is software that is both free and open source. It is
liberally licensed to grant users the right to use, copy, study,
change, and improve its design through the availability of its source
code. In the context of free and open-source software, free refers to
the freedom to copy and re-use the software, rather than to the price
of the software.</p><p>Libre-Halaal ByStar Ideology and FOSS Ideology have a
great deal in common and we closely collaborate with our FOSS brothers
and sisters, but the ByStar Libre-Halaal Ideology is distinct.</p><p>We invite our “Free Software” and “Open-Source” brothers and sisters
to recognize that the “Libre-Halaal Software” model is a more complete model
and that the “Libre-Halaal Software” label is a better label.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec241" Active Private Parallel Digital Ecosystems – Example: NSA-->
<h4 id="sec241" class="subsubsection">Active Private Parallel Digital Ecosystems – Example: NSA</h4><!--SEC END --><p>What we want to do on very large scale and in the open has been done 
in medium scale in private. </p><p>For instance, the United State’s National Security Agency (NSA) has
created a separate parallel private digital ecosystem for its own use.
NSA operates the private .nsa TLD; many NSA internal email addresses are of
the form username@r21.r.nsa, mirroring the NSA organizational group
structure. NSA has a particular ideology for its digital ecosystem
which includes a large element of security, confidentiality and
secrecy. NSA through use of its own particular software and services
has created a complete different environment in parallel to the
internet.</p><p>Precedence of such private parallel digital ecosystems combined with
the proven power of Libre-Halaal software demonstrates that widespread
realization of ByStar digital ecosystem is very viable.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec242" Relationship With Piecemeal Privacy and Autonomy Software And Services-->
<h4 id="sec242" class="subsubsection">Relationship With Piecemeal Privacy and Autonomy Software And Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Some engineers kind of get it and have been trying to build various piecemeal privacy and
autonomy software and services. Such efforts have always stayed limited in scope and
scale. That is primarily for two reasons. First, because the engineers have failed to connect with
society. And second, because piecemeal solutions don’t work. </p><p>We build on these piecemeal privacy and autonomy software and services and bring them into
ByStar as integrated and complete large scale services.</p><p>An example of a piecemeal privacy effort is PGP - Pretty Good Privacy. A bunch of engineers and
technologists use it amongst themselves but PGP never penetrated the society at large.
ByStar comes with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as an integral part of the service and
equivalent of PGP is an inherent part of ByStar.</p><p>Another example of a piecemeal privacy effort is Tor <a href="https://www.torproject.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">https://www.torproject.org</span></a>.
Tor attempts to accomplish traffic flow confidentiality just through redirection. Traffic
flow confidentiality is an inherent part of ByStar which includes redirection and layer 3
and layer 7 padding as well.</p>

philosophical, moral, societal and engineering terms, we now turn our
attention to the economic and business dimensions. </p><p>We are devout mono-existential capitalists. </p><p>The existing capitalist model for
mono-existentials is generally correct, in both philosophical and
economic terms. But the extension of the mono-existential capitalist
model into the domain of poly-existentials, based on the Western IPR
regime, is a grave mistake. Philosophically it is wrong. Societally it is harmful to
humanity. And economically it is unstable and vulnerable, since it can
be displaced by disruptive business models like ours. The ByStar Open
Business Plan explains how this will come about, and
how we will profit from this.</p><p>We expand on this in Chapter

<h4 id="sec244" class="subsubsection">Revenue model for Libre-Halaal Software</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The Libre-Haraam software model, operating under Western copyright restrictions, includes a
highly effective recurring revenue generation model: the proprietary software licensing
model.</p><p>But the Halaal manner of existence of software eliminates all restrictions on the
distribution and use of software. Thus the Proprietary-Haraam recurring revenue model is
also largely eliminated. Recurring revenues under the Libre-Halaal software model are much
less than under the Haraam software model.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec245" Revenue model for Libre-Halaal Internet Services-->
<h4 id="sec245" class="subsubsection">Revenue model for Libre-Halaal Internet Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The Halaal manner of existence of software creates a powerful generative development model
for Libre-Halaal Internet Services. This generative model is absent from Proprietary-Haraam Internet
Services. Thus Libre-Halaal Internet Services have a major advantage and can compete directly
with Proprietary-Haraam Internet Services in terms of development.</p><p>The basic recurring revenue models for Libre-Halaal Internet Service providers are
essentially the same as for Proprietary-Haraam Internet Service providers. Thus in terms
of revenue generation, Libre-Halaal and Proprietary-Haraam services are on an equal footing.</p>

notice that “Neda Operated By* Services” establish a direct
relationship with Subscribers and Users at the very top. Note that
the scope of these Internet services is everything – the * in By* –
and that the intended scale of these services is planet-wide. 
By definition, no Internet services opportunity can be bigger than that.</p><p>The arrows between Neda Services and User/Subscriber in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">14.7</a> include an element of “Trust, Loyalty, and
Respect” which is the result of “ByStar Ideology” that we presented
earlier. The element of trust and respect is fully absent in the left
column. In business terms, Trust and Respect, translate into
“stickiness” – where the user is more committed to the service.
So, you see, all our investments in ideology are actually also business
wise.</p><p>All of the ByStar value chain software is Libre-Halaal (Free and Open
Source) software. ByStar software in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">14.7</a> is shown in two different colors. </p><p>The software in bright blue represents Debian and/or Ubuntu GNU/Linux
and the specific software packages that we have chosen. These are
externally developed open source software packages which are typically
subject to the free software GPL license (or similar) which permits
their inclusion in proprietary services. This is often referred to as
ASP loophole.</p><p>The software in bright green is the software that Neda has developed. It is subject to
the “Affero General Public License Version 3” (AGPL3) and Neda Commercial License (Dual
Licensed). AGPL3 closes the ASP loophole. Any ASP which uses ByStar software must
subject its changes and improvements to AGPL3 and make its changes and improvements
publicly available. Those ASPs not wishing to do so, can use ByStar software through the
Neda Commercial License.</p><p>In the left column of Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">14.7</a>, we
illustrate a typical proprietary ASP who is incorporating ByStar as
part of its services based on the Neda Commercial License.</p><p>In this environment the model for implementation of By* service
functionality is not one of original software development. Rather it
is a matter of selection and integration of already available software
packages. Virtually all existing By* service functionality has been
created this way—in building By* we have written almost no new
software components at all.</p><p>Thus we are not so much in the business of software development, as we
are in the business of software integration. But the integration of
software components to produce a coherent service is far from trivial.
We have created a sophisticated technical integration environment for
this purpose, called the <span style="font-weight:bold">Neda Libre Services Integration
Platform</span> (Neda-LSIP) [<a href="#PLPC-110501">2</a>].</p><p>Design of LSIP and the <span style="font-weight:bold">ByStarEntity Software Platform</span> recognize the
evolution of underlying external software (bright blue) in the ByStar value chain.bywhere
This is the extraordinary magic of Libre-Halaal
software and services: the ability to take things and reuse them at extremely low
cost. This is the fundamental growth dynamic of Libre Services, and
the powerful generative force that is lacking in the proprietary
model. This is the key dynamic that causes the By* Libre Services
eventually to surpass the proprietary model entirely in terms of
features and functionality.</p>

publications list will be kept up-to-date.
The ByStar publications list is structured primarily for reference. Below we provide a
description of how these documents collectively draw a comprehensive picture.</p><p>The big ByStar picture is shown in Figure

<a href="#fig%3AbystarEcosystemRoadmap">14.8</a>. 


Each of the layers in this figure
represents either a conceptual definition (shown in blue), or an
actual software/service implementation (shown in orange). Each layer
builds on the layers beneath.</p><p>The layers in Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarEcosystemLayers">14.9</a> are color coded.
Each of the layers are either:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">A Conceptual Layer.</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Representing concepts. Layers 1,2,3,4,7 and 8 are in Green, Blue and Yellow.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">A Tangible Layer.</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Representing software/service implementations. Layers 5 and 6 are in Orange and Brown.
</dd></dl><p>The tangible layers are bound by the conceptual layers underneath them and receive
legitimacy from those concepts.</p><p>The conceptual layers are validated by the tangible layers.</p><p>The green layers (1 and 2) at the bottom are philosophical, moral and societal. Their
scope is wider than the moral digital ecosystem that we are after. Generally speaking,
these are not the domain of engineers. They are the domain of ethicists, philosophers and
sociologists.</p><p>The blue layers (3, 4 and 8) are philosophical, moral, societal, social and engineering aspects of
digital ecosystems that require direct involvement of engineers and the engineering
profession.
The yellow layer (7) addresses economics and business dimensions of ByStar.</p><p>The orange/brown layers (5 and 6) are engineering constructs. 
They are in-use software and in-use Internet application services.</p><p>In ByStar Roadmap: 
<a href="http://www.by-star.net/bxRoadmap">http://www.by-star.net/bxRoadmap</a><br>
we provide a reading roadmap to ByStar related articles.</p><p>Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarEcosystemLayers">14.9</a> shows how the moral, legal,
societal, engineering, economic and business dimensions of the ByStar
Halaal Digital Ecosystem are layered as described above.</p><p>Note the differing characterizations of this layering on the left and
right. Both characterizations are valid, but they reflect entirely
different viewpoints. The left side characterization is called “The
Human Model,” and reflects the philosophical, moral and societal
elements of the model. It also identifies the role of the engineering
profession in maintaining these elements. The right side
characterization is called “The Venture Capitalist Model,” and is
very different from the “The Human Model.” The same elements are
present, but now represent their significance as part of an investment
strategy. Thus the moral and societal concerns within the human model
are now viewed as a sales and marketing opportunity. This makes clear
that when dealing with Venture Capitalists, issues of morality and
societal welfare are not the topic of discussion. In this regard
Venture Capitalists need only understand that human beings are in fact
concerned with vital moral considerations such as “privacy” and
“autonomy,” and that these considerations have powerful sales and
marketing consequences. And that our unconventional strategy of

<h2 id="sec249" class="section">14.3  ByStarEntity Realization Models – By Way Of Some Examples</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="ByStarEntityRealizationExamples"></a></p><p>Let’s explore ByStar in the context of a few examples.
All these examples are completely fictional.</p><p>Let’s consider Bob Smith, a 46 year old university researcher and his
15 year old daughter, Alice Smith. Alice is a freshman (9th grader) at
Garfield High School (GHS).</p><p>Bob wishes to have the following in ByStar.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
An Autonomous ByName BxEntity for his private and public use – 5.bob.smith.byname.net (he is the 5th bob.smith requesting byname services).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">An Autonomous ByFamily BxEntity for his family – 8.smith.byfamily.net.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A Controlled ByFamily BxEntity for his daughter Alice –
alice.8.smith.byfamily.net (Alice is a minor and Bob wishes to have
the option of overseeing her communications).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A Controlled ByWhere BxEntity for their condo in Kirkland,
WA – 1-98034-3681-74.bywhere.net (say for reliable driving directions).
</li></ol><p>There are 3 different realization models for Autonomous BxEntity-s.</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Shared Cloud Autonomous Model
</li><li class="li-itemize">Hosted Private Cloud Autonomous Model
</li><li class="li-itemize">Premise Private Cloud Autonomous Model
</li></ul><p>Bob is concerned about privacy and prefers the “Hosted
Private Cloud Autonomous Model” over the “Shared Cloud Autonomous Model”.
He trusts the ByStar model enough not to need the “Premise Private Cloud Autonomous Model”.</p><p>In the following sections we describe ByStarEntity realization models
in the context of Bob and Alice’s example.</p><p>As we go through these examples, we will also be comparing them with
their counter part in the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec250" ByStarEntityId Registrations-->
<h3 id="sec250" class="subsection">14.3.1  ByStarEntityId Registrations</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Through ByStar, Bob needs to have an Autonomous ByName Registration,
an Autonomous ByFamily Registration and a Controlled ByWhere
Registration.</p><p>So, Bob goes to http://www.byname.net and provides his name “Bob”
“Smith” and an email address and agrees to conform to 
ByStar usage policies and in return, he receives:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
5.bob.smith.byname.net – BxEntityId=23. 1.2.7.3 .32674 – BxEntityIdPassword=
</li></ul><p>Similarly Bob goes to http://www.byfamily.net and provides his autonomous BxEntityId=23.1.2.7.3.32674 
and gets:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
8.smith.byfamily.net – BxEntityId=23. 1.2.9.5 .4689
</li></ul><p>He then provides his autonomous BxEntityId=23.1.2.7.3.32674 and
gets:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
1-98034-3681-74.bywhere.net – BxEntityId=27. 2.2.6.4 .4689
</li></ul><p>for a ByWhere controlled entity.</p><p>All of the above were external registrations. In the ByStar model,
Bob himself has now become a registrar for some ByStarEntitys. </p><p>Under the 8.smith.byfamily.net domain, Bob now registers </p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
bob.8.smith.byfamily.net – as BxEntityId=23. 1.2.9.5 .4689 .1
</li></ul><p>And </p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
alice.8.smith.byfamily.net – as BxEntityId=23. 1.2.9.5 .4689 .2
</li></ul><p>Note that Bob has the option of using a single password and that all
his ByStarEntityId are related.</p><p>With his 5 ByStarEntityIds in place, Bob now can realize his
ByStarEntitys in the model that he wishes.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec251" Shared Cloud Autonomous Model-->
<h3 id="sec251" class="subsection">14.3.2  Shared Cloud Autonomous Model</h3><!--SEC END --><p>This model is very similar to how Gmail and other proprietary Internet
services works. It involves Bob going to <a href="http://www.byname.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.byname.net</span></a>,
logging in and using the web service.</p><p>Even at this level, there is a big difference between the Proprietary
American Services and the Libre-Halaal ByStar Services. ByStar is
transparent – not opaque/dark/closed.</p><p>Even in the shared cloud autonomous model, Bob has the choice of
demanding that his entire service be delivered to him as a
ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine – that means the entire
software for the ByStar service and his entire data be delivered to
him. And that the service provider abide by the “Service Data
Portability” and “Service and Data Non-Retention” obligations.</p><p>In the Gmail (and other) Proprietary American Model there are no such concepts.</p>

<a id="AddingByStarEntitysToTheGenericByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine"></a></p><p>Bob then adds his ByStarEntitys to the ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine.</p><p>This involves Bob running the ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine on
his laptop and entering his ByStarEntityIds into the
ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine. 
All of Bob’s ByStar services are now added to his ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec255" Choosing A ByStar Private Cloud Provider – e.g. LibreCenter.net-->
<h4 id="sec255" class="subsubsection">Choosing A ByStar Private Cloud Provider – e.g. LibreCenter.net</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob then chooses a host for his Virtual Machine. </p><p>His choice of ByStar Private Cloud Provider may be influenced by the
location and laws of where the ByStar Private Cloud Provider operates
in. If U.S. wiretap laws are too invasive to his taste, he may choose
a ByStar Private Cloud Provider outside of the U.S. – ByStar is very global.</p><p>Let’s say that Bob chose <a href="http://www.librecenter.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.librecenter.net</span></a>.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec256" Running Your ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine-->
<h4 id="sec256" class="subsubsection">Running Your ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob then transfers his fully configured
ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine to <a href="http://www.librecenter.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.librecenter.net</span></a>
and runs the service.</p><p>Bob is now in control of his own service.</p><p>ByStar and LibreCenter have given Bob what is necessary and are
supporting him. Bob is in possession of all of the service’s software
and the service is Bob’s.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec257" Premise Private Cloud Autonomous Model-->
<h3 id="sec257" class="subsection">14.3.4  Premise Private Cloud Autonomous Model</h3><!--SEC END --><p>In the Premise Private Cloud Autonomous Model, Bob is in possession

service.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec258" Obtaining A Premise ByStar Host-->
<h4 id="sec258" class="subsubsection">Obtaining A Premise ByStar Host</h4><!--SEC END --><p>A Premise ByStar Host is a computer with a static public IP address
capable of running a ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine.
Any modern desktop or laptop would do just fine.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec259" Preparing The ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine-->
<h4 id="sec259" class="subsubsection">Preparing The ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob does what was previously described in 
Section <a href="#ObtainingAGenericByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine">14.3.3</a>
and
Section <a href="#AddingByStarEntitysToTheGenericByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine">14.3.3</a>
to prepare his ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine.</p><p>A typical ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine is capable of
containing 100s of ByStarEntitys.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec260" Running The Premise ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine-->
<h4 id="sec260" class="subsubsection">Running The Premise ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob then puts his ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine on his “Premise ByStar Host”
and runs it.</p><p>Bob now possesses all of the software for ByStar.<br>
Bob now possesses all of his own data.<br>
Bob now possesses all of his logs and audit trails.<br>
Bob now controls all of his services.</p><p>This means real and tangible autonomy.</p><p>Efforts like FreedomBox have been attempting to accomplish this in a
more limited fashion. But in the ByStar model the Premise Private
Cloud Autonomous Model is just one of many ways to realize tangible
autonomy.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec261" ByStar Autonomous Services Use and Access Examples-->
<h3 id="sec261" class="subsection">14.3.5  ByStar Autonomous Services Use and Access Examples</h3><!--SEC END --><p>So, now Bob and Alice have a number of autonomous services in place.
Now, let’s see how they will be accessing them and what these 
ByStar Autonomous Services can do for Bob and Alice.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec262" Browser Based Web Service Usage-->
<h4 id="sec262" class="subsubsection">Browser Based Web Service Usage</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Most ByStar services are also offered as interactive web services just like
traditional web services.</p><p>The generic ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine includes all
ByStar user environments. A Tor-Firefox browser is all you need for
ByStar interactive web services.</p><p>But the prefered model for accessing ByStar services is through Blee.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec263" Blee Based Software-Service Continuum Usage-->
<h4 id="sec263" class="subsubsection">Blee Based Software-Service Continuum Usage</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Blee (ByStar Libre Emacs Environment) is a layer above Emacs and
Firefox that integrates ByStar platform (Debian GNU/Linux)
capabilities into Emacs and provides for integration with ByStar
Services. </p><p>Use of Blee makes for a very rich software-service continuum model that
does not have a real counter-part in the Proprietary American Digital
Ecosystem.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec264" Some Examples Of ByStar Autonomous Services Capabilities-->
<h3 id="sec264" class="subsection">14.3.6  Some Examples Of ByStar Autonomous Services Capabilities</h3><!--SEC END --><p>With everything in place, let’s see what are some of their ByStar
capabilities. ByStar full set of Autonomous capabilities is determined by
the capabilities of Bob’s ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine.
These are already quite powerful and they are ever growing. 
Below we mention some.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec265" ByStar Email (Messaging)-->
<h4 id="sec265" class="subsubsection">ByStar Email (Messaging)</h4><!--SEC END --><p>In terms of email capabilities, ByStar email is similar to Gmail.
However, ByStar email is very autonomous, very personal and very
private.</p><p>For example, note that email communications between Bob and Alice need
not even leave Bob’s ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine.</p><p>Beyond Gmail like capabilities, ByStar email service is inherently
multi-address and multi-mailbox.</p><p>For example Bob and Alice can each have a specific address for Alice’s
school – Garfield High School (GHS). Those email addresses would be:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
ghs@alice.8.smith.byfamily.net
</li><li class="li-itemize">ghs@bob.8.smith.byfamily.net
</li></ul><p>Libre-Halaal ByStar email services are superior to Proprietary-Haraam
email services both in capability and privacy.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec266" ByStar Public and Private Web Presence Services-->
<h4 id="sec266" class="subsubsection">ByStar Public and Private Web Presence Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>ByStar public and private web presence services are very rich. 
They are based on the Plone Content Management System. </p><p>The URL for Bob’s public web site would be
http://5.bob.smith.byname.net. Its capabilities could be similar to
the author of this document’s site: <a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span></a>.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec267" ByStar Photo and Video Galleries-->
<h4 id="sec267" class="subsubsection">ByStar Photo and Video Galleries</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob and Alice and their family’s (8.smith.byfamily.net) photo gallery can be
similar to what is in: <a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/albums"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/albums</span></a>.</p><p>ByStar Photo and Video Galleries are based on galleria and are
integrated into Plone. ByStar photo gallery capabilities comfortably
compete with the likes of flickr and photo bucket. The difference of
course is that Bob and Alice remain in control of their photos with ByStar.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec268" ByStar Genealogy Services-->
<h4 id="sec268" class="subsubsection">ByStar Genealogy Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob and Alice can build their genealogy tree in ways 
similar to what is in:
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/genealogy"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/genealogy</span></a>.</p><p>ByStar Genealogy Services are based on geneweb. ByStar genealogy
capabilities comfortably compete with the likes of ancestry.com, 
FamilySearch, and MyTrees.com. </p><p>The difference of course is that with ByStar, Bob and Alice remain in
control of their genealogy personal information.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec269" ByStar Libre Content Self-Publication Services-->
<h4 id="sec269" class="subsubsection">ByStar Libre Content Self-Publication Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Bob Smith is an academic. He writes and publishes a lot. Some of his
thoughts and writings are outside of the mainstream. As a true academic,
he prefers not to subject his publications to restrictions that the
likes of IEEE and ACM demand. His publication philosophy is consistent with
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/publications">ByStar
Publication Philosophy</a>.</p><p>He uses the <a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/180038">ByStar Content
Production and Content Publication Facilities</a> to write and publish.</p><p>The list of his publications is similar to what is in:<br>
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/publications/collections/bystarDE"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/publications/collections/bystarDE</span></a>.</p><p>The access page to Bob’s documents are similar to this document’s:
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/PLPC/180016"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net/PLPC/180016</span></a>.</p><p>Bob, can optionally use ByStar Federated Services to achieve
permanence and ease of search and access to his writings. See Section
<a href="#ByStarFederatedServicesExamples">14.3.7</a> for more details.</p><p>So, ByStar has empowered Bob to be a true academic and avoid pseudo
academic copyright-ed publication traditions.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec270" ByStar Federated Services Examples-->
<h3 id="sec270" class="subsection">14.3.7  ByStar Federated Services Examples</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="ByStarFederatedServicesExamples"></a></p><p>Bob has chosen to subject some of his publications to “Federated
Re-Publication”.<br>
He uses <a href="http://www.bycontent.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.bycontent.net</span></a> for that.</p><p>ByContent is a ByStar Federated Service where ByStar self-published
documents are republished. </p><p>By submitting some of his documents and podcasts (videos) for
ByContent re-publication, Bob accomplishes several things.</p><p>ByContent Federated Services offer the following:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Permanence. If Bob’s web site or he, himself disappear, his
documents still remain.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Large volume publication. ByContent runs on large computers with
access to lots of bandwidth. Bob need not worry about slowness of
access to his public videos and public writings.
</li><li class="li-itemize">ByContent republication maintains reference to original source.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Classification with peer content. Bob’s content is classified and
sits next to other similar and competing content.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Searchability. Bob’s content are now subject to search features of 
<a href="http://www.BySearch.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.BySearch.org</span></a>
</li></ul><p>ByContent is similar to YouTube. Except that ByContent
allows your content to be clearly refered back to you. All of
ByContent is copyleft.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec271" Bob And Alice’s ByStar Digital Ecosystem-->
<h3 id="sec271" class="subsection">14.3.8  Bob And Alice’s ByStar Digital Ecosystem</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Now, Let’s look at this example in its entirety and see what Bob and
Alice gained by buying into the ByStar Digital Ecosystem.</p><p>First, they lost nothing. ByStar exists in parallel to the proprietary
Internet. Everything that everybody else can do, Bob and Alice can do
as well. Through peer pressure Alice will likely be pushed to join
Facebook.</p><p>But, Bob and Alice now have autonomous and private email. They
communicate with everybody else in normal email fashion. But they are in
control of their personal messages. When Bob deletes an email he knows
that the email has truly been deleted. </p><p>And Bob and Alice are truly in control of what they do with their
photos, and their content on the Internet. </p><p>That can be considered a good begining. ByStar is evolutionary. ByStar
is designed to be ever-growing and comprehensive.</p><p>Are you ready to follow Bob and Alice’s example?</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec272" Dynamics of the Libre-Halaal vs. Proprietary-Haraam Battle-->
<h2 id="sec272" class="section">14.4  Dynamics of the Libre-Halaal vs. Proprietary-Haraam Battle</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Though it is not part of popular cultural awareness, there is
currently a titanic battle taking place between two competing
ideologies: the proprietary software model (exemplified by Windows),
and <a href="http://www.halaalsoftware.org">the libre-halaal software
model</a> (exemplified by GNU/Linux). This is a to-the-death battle,
from which there can eventually emerge only a single winner.</p><p>The software battle is part of a broader ideological contest, about
ownership models for
<a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120033">poly-existentials in
general</a> (software, but also including literature, music, images,
movies, etc.) in the digital era. This ideological war is rooted in
the manner-of-existence of digital entities as this has broader
ramifications for individuals and society – which impact autonomy,
privacy, freedom, and social interaction.</p><p>The inherent nature of software, Internet services and other poly-existentials is
fundamentally at odds with these historical conventions of physical property
(mono-existentials) ownership. Such constructs have the inherent potential for unlimited
replicability and dissemination, and in the age of the Internet this potential is now
fully realized.</p><p>As a result the existing western Intellectual Property conventions are coming under
increasing stress, as the internal forces of replicability clash with the externally
constraining Intellectual Property framework. The Intellectual Property regime is also
coming under formal intellectual attack, as the dysfunctionality and true costs of this
regime become increasingly apparent.</p><p>In practice, the proprietary software and services model has engaged
in various forms of bastardization of libre-halaal software
model. Well recognized examples of such bastardizations include the
service loophole, Tivoization, Appleization, and Androidization. </p><p>In practice, open-source and free software movements represent compromising
models and ideologies. For the most part they are comfortable being intertwined with
the proprietary model. Full rejection of the proprietary model is
considered radical in much of the open-source culture.</p><p>In practice, with ByStar ideology we accomplish three things. First,
we create a completely separate and independent digital ecosystem that
fully rejects the proprietary model. Second, we take all possible
measures to prevent bastardization of ByStar software and services by
the proprietary model. Third, we create a comprehensive internet
services business model which competes directly with the proprietary
model in terms of revenue and profit.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec273" Engineering vs. Business-->
<h3 id="sec273" class="subsection">14.4.1  Engineering vs. Business</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Today, the Internet services industry is owned entirely by business
interests. But the Libre Services and By* initiatives represent a
startling challenge to this: they represent a determined reassertion
of proper guardianship of the Internet by Engineering. This challenge
will bring us into massive conflict with existing commercial
interests, who will fight ferociously to defend the status quo.</p><p>Table <a href="#tab%3AengBusinessWarfare">14.1</a> shows the many elements of contrast
between the Engineering and Business value systems. As the table makes
clear, these two values systems are in complete and total conflict. We
will fully exploit this conflict as the metaphor of a war: a war
between Engineering and Business, in which Business represents
exploitation of the Internet for profit, and Engineering represents
guardianship of the Internet on behalf of the public.</p><blockquote class="table"><div class="center"><hr style="width:80%;height:2"></div>

interests in opposition to it, the promotion of ByStar amounts to a kind of

every respect: technological, economic, societal etc. But it is essential that
all this be communicated effectively.</p><p>The ByStar Wars (to coin a phrase) will be fought on multiple fronts. But as a

<h3 id="sec276" class="subsection">14.4.4  Libre-Halaal Software Based Formulation Of National Policies In Western Societies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>While America leads Internet technology today, full adoption of ByStar
based on ByStar ideology will likely be difficult in America.</p><p>Simply put, it is naive to imagine that there is any hope that Libre-Halaal Software (or
any form of non-proprietary software) can become basis for formulation of national policies in
any Western society.</p><p>This is because of a number of a reasons, including: 
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Intellectual Property Rights regime is an integral part of Western cultures. Even
after it becomes obvious that the Western intellectual property rights regime is
corrupt, economic interests will keep it in place. In many ways this parallels the
history of Slavery in America.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Western societies are primarily economically driven. Halaal and Haraam for anything,
generally (if not always) remain fringe concepts.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The Proprietary model is fully entrenched. And the course for using the proprietary
model for internal and external exploitation is already fully charted.
</li></ul><p>In the West there is track record for where Libre-Halaal software and Internet services
fit in Western societies. The advantages of being in harmony with nature has not been
sufficient to bring GNU/Linux to the center – other than through economically driven
bastardizations of Libre-Halaal software such as Appleization, Tivoization,
Androidization, etc.</p><p>There is one aspect of halaal software and halaal Internet services that is congruent with
Western cultures. It is of course “freedom” based.</p>

Internet services model. Autonomy, privacy and liberty are being crushed.</p><p>ByStar is the cure for those Westerners who value autonomy and liberty and who recognize 
the current ills and trends.</p><p>We offer the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem and ByStar ideology to Americans the
very same way that it is being offered to all societies – there to be understood and
taken.</p>

<h3 id="sec278" class="subsection">14.4.5  Libre-Halaal Software Based Formulation Of National Policies In Eastern Societies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Libre-Halaal software and Libre-Halaal Internet services have a much better chance of becoming a basis
for formulation of national policies in Eastern societies.</p><p>This is because of a number of reasons including: </p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Rejection of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime
is easier and more beneficial to Eastern societies. 
</li><li class="li-itemize">Eastern societies are less economically driven and the general concept of halaal and
haraam play a more significant role in Eastern societies.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Proprietary software and Proprietary Internet services are used by the West as an
instrument of exploitation and neo-colonialism against many Eastern societies in
economic and political contexts. And whom ever objects to America and the american model
is swiftly subjected to american freedom and american democracy through facebook and
twiter.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Unowned Halaal Software provides an alternative to the Proprietary American
software. The collaborative model of Halaal Software permits for collective efforts for
replacing American Proprietary Software.
</li></ul><p>We expand on these below.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec279" Eastern Tear Point: Full Rejection Of Western IPR Regime-->
<h4 id="sec279" class="subsubsection">Eastern Tear Point: Full Rejection Of Western IPR Regime</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Any halaal software based formulation of national policies in eastern societies
demands full rejection of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>It is much easier for Eastern societies to conclude that 
the Western IPR regime is morally wrong and that it is being 
used as an instrument of Western neo-colonialism.</p><p>Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem thrives when Western
IPR is rejected.</p><p>The full beauty and power of ByStar will not be realized, until a culture whose ideology
resonates with ByStar ideology, is ready to fully adopt ByStar.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec280" Eastern Tear Point: Societal Autonomy-->
<h4 id="sec280" class="subsubsection">Eastern Tear Point: Societal Autonomy</h4><!--SEC END --><p>In the context of software, as an example, let’s consider the dependence of Arabs and
Iranians on American proprietary software.</p><p>Today if you want to write in Persian or in Arabic, your main choice is Microsoft’s
Proprietary-Haraam Windows environment. And in the business driven Western model,
Perso-Arabic users are always second class citizens because they represent an
insignificant market to the likes of American Microsoft and American Google. In other
words computing and communication capabilities of Perso-Arabic societies is determined by
Americans.</p><p>Eastern societies recognize this and see how Libre-Halaal Software can provide an alternative.</p><p>For example, what is maintained in <a href="http://www.persoarabic.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.persoarabic.org</span></a> provides an
alternative to the Proprietary Windows environment for Perso-Arabic processing. And
provides societal autonomy with respect to software for Perso-Arabic cultures.</p>

<h4 id="sec281" class="subsubsection">Worldly/Eastern Tear Point: Inherently Collaborative vs Inherently Competitive</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The libre-halaal model creates an entirely new environment in terms of competition,
collaboration, and value chain relationships.
Libre-Halaal software and Internet Services are genuine public resources, not owned by
anyone, freely available for reuse by anyone. They are created by society/humanity, for
society/humanity.</p><p>This general proven collaborative model permits for collective efforts for replacing
American Proprietary Software which from the perspective of an Eastern society is far more
cost effective than the proprietary competitive model.</p>

<a id="chap:PromulgativeEthicalAndReligiousCures"></a>
</p><p>Questions of Ownership are the inherent domain of morality, ethics and religion.</p><p>Earlier we said “IPR is Haraam”, but who are we to make such declarations? Uses and
introductions of halaal and haraam by individuals here and there are of some importance
and significance. But, it is broad consensus and widespread acceptance of halaal and
haraam that results in significant moral impact. Halaal and haraam declaration are more
significant when they reflect consensus of a profession. Halaal and haraam declaration are
far more meaningful when they reflect the consensus of a religion.
Ethical Halaal is far more significant than moral Halaal.</p><p>How are we to arrive at that broad consensus and widespread acceptance? </p><p>In the West, people attempt at expressing their take on right and wrong and all of that
right and wrong becomes quickly irrelevant when economics comes into the picture – as
economics is the center of the Western model. So, for the most part, halaal and
haraam are academic and anecdotal in the West.</p><p>To the extent that religions can be considered vehicles for promotion of morality and
ethics, based on their track record; a religion can be considered weaker or stronger
compared to another religion.</p><p>Church and State were easily separated in the West as Christianity
is a weak religion.
Christianity draws a clear separation between the two worlds and the two times. 
The Western Christian model has become very “Secular” now.
The
definition of the purely Western word and the concept of “Secular” by Webster is:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Of or pertaining to this present world, or to things not
spiritual or holy; relating to temporal as distinguished
from eternal interests; not immediately or primarily
respecting the soul, but the body; worldly.
</blockquote><p>In that simple Western Christian model, the Church is in control of the other world
(heaven and hell) and the State is in control of this world. And the State quickly boils
down to economics and the Corporation.</p><p>The concepts of halaal and haraam are totally absent in Christianity. Christianity does
not concern itself much with this world.</p><p>Westerners consider their idea of separation of church and state as prescriptive.
They believe that their notion of church applies to all religions and 
that their concept of religion emanating from Christianity is universal.
The concept of separation of religion and state is in no way universal. </p><p>Unlike Christianity, Islam is a strong religion which concerns itself fully with both
worlds. The founding fathers of the Islamic Republic were quite familiar with the West’s
history of the Dark Ages. Those who wrote the Islamic Republic’s constitution had read the
French and the American constitution and were familiar with the lessons of the French and
the American revolution. The founding fathers of the Islamic Republic 
fully understood the Western concepts of separation of church and state
and they fully rejected these concepts.</p><p>The model of fusing Islam and the Republic is complex and powerful. It is only such a
model that can preserve humanity and it is only this model that can stand against the
Western model of economic creatures calling their collection a society.</p><p>Halaal and haraam are of this world. Halaal and haraam are for this world. Only a
religion that fully concerns itself with both worlds can properly drive forward, Halaals
and Haraams. <a id="hevea_default117"></a>Secular Western and Christian models of focusing on each of the two worlds
separately, at best will result into highly diluted Halaals and Haraams.</p><p>In the Muslim model, declarations of halaal and haraam by sources of imitation play an
important role in moving society forward as new topics for Halaal and Haraam arise.</p><p>For example, towards societal consensus on halaal manner-of-existence of software,
consider Imam Khomeini<a id="hevea_default118"></a>’s fatwa on invalidity of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime
which has paved the way towards current sources of imitation digesting the software
engineering profession’s definition of halaal manner-of-existence of software.</p><p>Consensus amongst Muslim sources of imitation in recognizing halaal
manner-of-existence of software and halaal manner-of-existence of internet services can
result in significant moral impact towards preventing the harm that the current disastrous Western
model of manner-of-existence of software and internet services are headed for.</p><p>Majority of Grand Ayatollah’s are against so-called IPR Regime.</p><p>We humbly offer our professional analysis to Ghom<a id="hevea_default119"></a> and Najaf<a id="hevea_default120"></a> towards
establishing a full consensus against the Western so-called IPR Regime.</p><p>Explicit and repeated fatwas against the Western so-called IPR Regime
will assist the cure.</p><p>We humbly offer our professional analysis to Vatican and Protestants
towards establishing a full consensus against the Western so-called
IPR Regime.</p><p>Explicit and repeated decrees against the Western so-called IPR Regime
will assist the cure.</p>

Imam Khomeini (peace be upon him) in Tahrir ol-vasileh on the subject of Western Intellectual Property has written:
<div class="flushright"><p>امام خميني(ره) در تحرير‌الوسيله در بحث مسائل مستحدثه با اشاره به مسأله مورد بحث مي‌فرمايند:</p></div><p>That which has become famous among people as the
right of authorship (copyright) is not a theological or an
ethical right.
And to take away the control of people on their
belongings without explicit condition and contract is not
permitted. And just by writing a sentence saying “Copyright: Print and Copying Rights are Reserved” 
creates no right and does not require conformance of others.</p><div class="flushright"><p>آنچه كه معروف به حق طبع نزد افراد است حق شرعي به شمار نمي‌آيد و زايل نمودن سلطه مردم بر
اموالشان بدون اينكه شرط و عقدي در بين باشد جايز نيست و مجرد نوشتن جمله «حق چاپ و تقليد
محفوظ است» حقي به وجود نمي‌آورد و التزام ديگران را به دنبال ندارد.</p></div><p>That which has become famous as “registration of invention”
(patents) creates no theological or ethical rights for the
inventor and can not prevent others in copying or reproducing
that invention. And you can not restrict people from copying
that invention and you can not restrict them in conducting
commerce which is based on that invention. And no one has a
right to restrict another with regard to his full ruler-ship on
his own property.</p><p>And also that which has become famous as “Monopoly Of Commerce Over An Object Or Objects” (trademark)
for an organization or a number of merchants or the like has no theological or ethical lawful impact.
And restricting others is commerce and industry based on monopoly of a few is not permitted.</p><div class="flushright"><p>آنچه كه معروف است به «ثبت اختراع» براي مخترعش و منع ديگران از تقليد او و تكثير نمودن آن
اختراع هيچ اثر شرعي ندارد و نمي‌توان افراد را از تقليد نمودن آن اختراع و تجارت و كسب كردن
با آن منع كرد و هيچ كس حق ندارد ديگري را از سلطنت در اموال خودش منع كند. و نيز آنچه كه
معروف است از «انحصاري بودن تجارت يك شيء يا اشياء» براي موسسه‌اي يا تعدادي از تجار يا مانند
اين‌ها هيچ اثر شرعي ندارد و بازداشتن ديگران از تجارت و صنعت حلال و محصور دانستن در حق چند
نفر جايز نمي‌باشد.</p></div></blockquote><p>There are several things to note in Imam Khomeini’s writings:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
The equivalent words for copyright, patent and trademark are non-existent in Arabic and Farsi.
These are Western constructs.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Imam Khomeini therefore refers to the equivalent phrase translation
into Arabic and Farsi for these and further prefaces them with
“that which has become famous”. These emphasize that
copyright, patent and trademark are non-Iranian and non-Islamic
concepts which he fully rejects.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The essence of Imam Khomeini’s rejection of copyright, patent and trademark
is the dilutive impact on ownership of real property. 
With respect to copyright and patent Imam Khomeini emphasizes the importance of 
one’s full ruler-ship over one’s own property.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Imam Khomeini’s rejection of Western so-called Intellectual
Property is absolute, complete and total. Imam Khomeini fully rejects copyright, patent and trademark
and considers them unlawful.
</li></ul><p>Imam Khomeini is the Founding Father of Islamic Republic of Iran
who has fully invalidated the so-called Western IPR regime.</p><p>Particularly well-known Founding Fathers of America like George
Washington and James Madison can be considered as originators of
the American intellectual property protection.</p><p>Imam Khomeini was a theologian, a philosopher and an ethicist.
America’s Founding Fathers were businessmen. It is this
difference in perspectives (philosphy vs economics) that has lead to
different conclusions on this topic. Governance of
poly-existentials by economic creatures for economic creatures
would be distinct and different from governance of
poly-existentials by humans for humanity.</p>

regime and Americanism are deep rooted and can not be realistically
changed in the foreseeable future.</p><p>However, we consider it realistic to offer a specific
roadmap towards curing Eastern societies. We call these “Theoretical
Eastern Societal Cures”. If our theories were to be followed, cures could be
at hand for Eastern societies that wish to implement them.</p><p>All previous sections of this document have been towards this:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">

theoretical Eastern societal cures to the Western IPR disease. 
Deep understanding of nature of poly-existentials leads to the
recognition that societal and national policies need to be consistent
and harmonized with halaal manner-of-existence of poly-existentials.</p><p>The Western IPR regime is a vulnerable economic system. Eastern
sovereigns can do a number on Western IPR vulnerabilities.</p><p>Doing so requires deep understandings of the flaws and vulnerabilities
of the Western IPR regime and Libre-Halaal formulation of
poly-existential national policies that unleash natural forces that
work against the Western IPR regime.</p><p>In this section we focus on such cultivations with a narrow

are equally applicable to any Eastern society (China, Brazil,

several reasons. First, we are Iran<a id="hevea_default136"></a>ian. Second, Iran<a id="hevea_default137"></a> is very well

Iranians on American proprietary software.</p><p>Today if you want to write in Farsi or in Arabic, your main choice is Microsoft’s Proprietary-Haraam
Windows environment. And in the business driven (not societal or engineering driven)
western model, Perso-Arabic users are always second class citizens because they represent
an insignificant market to the likes of American Microsoft and American Google. In other
words computing and communication capabilities of Perso-Arabic societies is determined by
Americans.</p><p>Eastern societies recognize this and see how Libre-Halaal Software can provide an alternative.</p><p>For example, what is maintained in <a href="http://www.persoarabic.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.persoarabic.org</span></a> provides an
alternative to the Proprietary Windows environment for Perso-Arabic processing. And
can provide societal autonomy with respect to software for Perso-Arabic cultures.</p><p>Libre-Halaal software and Libre-Halaal Internet services have a much better chance of becoming a basis
for formulation of national policies in Eastern societies.</p><p>This is because of a number of reasons including: </p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">

Many crucial national policies need to be made to deal 
with poly-existentials.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of poly-existentials, at the highest level of 
societal governance – The Leader, Sources Of Imitation, President, National Legislators –
need to take on the question of:<br>
What is the halaal manner-of-existence of poly-existentials?</p><p>This can then be further refined as:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
The Western IPR regime, as shown in this document leads to the
Proprietary-Haraam Manner Of Existence Of Poly-Existentials.<p>The Western IPR Regime should be rejected in the global sense and 
the inroads of Western IPR regime within Eastern societies should be abolished.</p></li><li class="li-itemize">For each poly-existential (digitals, software, movies,
pharmaceuticals, etc) Halaal manner-of-existence of that
poly-existential should be determined by ethicists (The Leader,
Sources Of Imitation, etc) and the profession of that
poly-existential. Clear definitions for Halaal manner-of-existence
of each poly-existential is needed.</li><li class="li-itemize">For Software in particular, we have offered our criteria for
halaal manner-of-existence of software as “Libre-Halaal Software” as outlined in 
Section
<a href="#sec%3ALibre-HalaalSoftware--HalaalManner-of-ExistenceofSoftware">4.6.2</a> –

</li></ul><p>Amongst these, a clear statement and rationale for illegitimacy of the 
Western IPR regime is most important. </p><p>Imam Khomeini<a id="hevea_default150"></a><a id="hevea_default151"></a>’s position on this topic as described in Section
<a href="#sec%3AImamKhomeini%27sDecreeInvalidatesSo-CalledIntellectualPropertyRights">??</a> –
sec:ImamKhomeini’sDecreeInvalidatesSo-CalledIntellectualPropertyRights,
would have paved the way towards what is needed from the
society’s leaders with regard to the question of: “What is the Halaal
Manner-Of-Existence Of Poly-Existentials?”</p><p>The current situation in Iran is actually quite unclear.</p><p>Over the recent years, many west-toxicated 
Iranians have been pushing for mimicking Western copyright and patent models. And they
have had some success. So, with respect to acceptance or rejection of Western Intellectual
Property Rights regime, Iran’s position is quite muddy.</p><p>Iran is a non-signatory to <a id="hevea_default152"></a>WTO (<a id="hevea_default153"></a>Western Trade Organization)
copyright laws, but crisp full rejection of the concept of
copyright and patent as was explicitly stated by Imam
Khomeini<a id="hevea_default154"></a> has not been asserted again. In
recent years, a parallel to the Western IPR regime has been
shaping Iranian practices.</p><p>Moving towards a society based on halaal manner-of-existence of
software requires crisp declarations that fully invalidate western
intellectual property rights regime. And, this is in Iranian society’s
best interest.</p><p>Acceptance or rejection of merits of Western Intellectual Property
Rights Regime, above all, is a moral and ethical question. Not a
business or economics question.</p><p>We humbly request for the Iranian Leader (Ayatollah Ozma Khamenei) and
other Shia Ayatollahs to reach consensus on “Property” as it relates
to poly-existentials. The theological aspects of “Property” are so
very fundamental in any religion and Islam in particular that lack of
a clear consensus amongst all sources of imitation can not be healthy.</p><p>The logic that we have presented in this document makes it clear that
poly-existentials can not be property and that the Western IPR regime
is erroneous. And mimicking the Western IPR should not be the Iranian
way.</p><p>We look to Shia sources of imitation to either endorse our logic and 
conclusions or point out to where they think we have gone wrong.</p><p>It is only through full rejection of the Western IPR regime that 
our theoretical eastern societal cures can have an impact.
Any Libre-Halaal software based formulation of national policies in eastern societies
demands full rejection of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>Libre-Halaal software in general and Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital
Ecosystem thrives when Western IPR is rejected.</p><p>We also look to Shia sources of imitation to either endorse our
definitions of Libre-Halaal Software and Libre-Halaal Internet
Services or point us to their 
criteria for halaal manner-of-existence of software and 
their criteria for halaal manner-of-existence of internet services.</p>

obvious choice.</p><p>We then need to establish a layer above Debian Gnu/Linux to form a national distro.
This layer above Debian Gnu/Linux would have three primary purposes:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Localize/nationalize the global Debian Gnu/Linux
</li><li class="li-itemize">Create a common software base that would permit pointing to 
central national names and numbers authorities (e.g., DNS root servers).
</li><li class="li-itemize">Form a software foundation for building and using of
consistent Internet services such as ByStar.
</li></ul><p>In an ad-hoc fashion and in a limited sense this has been
happening in various Eastern societies. The list below was
compiled in 2017 and has not been fully verified in all respects.</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">China:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> The Chinese have been building the likes of Ubuntu
Kylin as their Chinese OS. <p>China also has a Chinese version of all popular web
services. Baidu for Google, Weibo for Twitter, 51.com for
Facebook. The list is endless. It is not surprising that China
has its own operating system Ubuntu/Debian Kylin. As the name suggests
Kylin is based on Ubuntu with extensive support for the Chinese
language. However, all of these are essentially in the spirit
of responding to the Western model. Even China has not yet
asserted its Digital Independence. That would require full
rejection of the Western IPR regime.</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Cuba:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Cuba’s national OS Nova is also based on Ubuntu/Debina.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">North Korea:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> North Korea has its own national OS based on
Linux and it goes by the name of Red Star OS. It has been
under development since 2002. Since North Korea has been forced
to be a closed society, there is not all that much information
available on Red Star OS.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">India:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions) is a
Debian based Linux OS being developed by India’s C-DAC (a
government owned organization for advanced computing
development).<p>The Indian government has also adopted an Open

some state government has started to switch to open document

produce “Sharif Linux”, which has since been abandoned as many of
its developers took the “bus” and are now in Silicon Valley.
Clearly an Iranian national OS is needed.
There have also been various other attempts 
such as Parsix GNU Linux. Ghasedak OS, Jabir OS and XAMIN.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Russia:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> In Russia’s private sector and military, there are

even mandated (at a minimum in the public sector) software.</p><p>Buidling of a National OS should go well beyond localizing Linux.
While localizing Linux is a local/national activity. Moving
towards a foundation for autonomy oriented National OS can be an
Eastern activity.</p><p>A National OS can permit, for example a society’s own DNS servers, 
block chains and (Public Key Infrastructures) PKIs.</p><p>And a National OS can be the foundational software on top of which 
consistent Internet services can be built.</p>

</blockquote><p>In that document we had explicitly identified the ’415 patent and had warned about WAP technology
being booby trapped with patents. The relevant section is reproduced below:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>2.3 Not Patent-Free</p><p>...</p><p>The WAP specification, however, is burdened with
several patent restrictions. These include
patents held by certain members of the WAP Forum
itself, most notably Phone.com and Geoworks.
Patent infringement claims have already been made
by the holders of the following patents:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
U.S. Patent # 5,327,529 (Geoworks). Process of designing user’s
interfaces for application programs.</li><li class="li-itemize">U.S. Patent # 5,809,415 (Phone.com, formerly Unwired Planet).
Method and architecture for an interactive two-way data
communication network.</li></ul><p>More patent infringement claims can almost
certainly be expected in the future.</p></blockquote><p>About 12 years after writing that document when the ’415 patent was
asserted against Apple and RIM, we were considered prescient. Irell
and Manella LLP on behalf of RIM found us and hired us to assist in
defending the patent assertions.</p><p>The life cycle of these typical patents demonstrate that the
rituals surrounding patent law really amounts to a negative-sum
game.</p><p>Alain Rossmann and collaborators made a whole lot of money through
using the 415-series-patents as a basis for a pump-and-dump
scheme. Many new investors lost money. A whole lot of lawyers made some money. As patent
defense engineering consultants we too made some money – our services are available
only in defense against patent assertions.</p><p>But, in the aggregate nothing of enduring value was created as a result
of the 415-series-patents. And we now have a Patent Assertion Entity
in charge of the patents.</p><p>Not patented alternative technologies became enduring solutions.</p><p>We would all have been better off if the 415-series-patents did not exist,
or better yet, if the patent system did not exist.</p>

صرف چنين نوشته اى عنوان قرار داد با ديگران بحساب نمى آيد در نتيجه
ديگران مى توانند آنرا چاپ و از آن تقليد كنند و كسى نمى تواند از اينكار
بازشان بدارد.</p><p>چهارم - اينكه در اين اعصار متعارف شده كه اختراع صنعتى
را براى مخترع آن ثبت مى دهند تا ديگران را از تقليد از آن و تكثير آن
منع كنند هيچ اثر شرعى ندارد و جايز نيست ديگران را از تقليد آن و تجارت

«تسلط مردم بر اموالشان بدون معاقده و مشارطه اى سلب شود»

make use of a comprehensive and well-integrated set of tools, including:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Debian GNU/Linux is our base platform
</li><li class="li-itemize">Emacs is our editor-based user environement
</li><li class="li-itemize">TeX, LaTeX, XeTeX, XeLaTeX is our document processor
</li><li class="li-itemize">Emacs bidi (bidirectional) capability is used to write in mixed Persian and Globish
</li><li class="li-itemize">xepersian LaTeX package is used to process Persian documents
</li><li class="li-itemize">LaTeX beamer package is used to prepare presentation slides
</li><li class="li-itemize">Emacs auctex mode is used to create documents in LaTeX
</li><li class="li-itemize">Aspell via Emacs is used for spell checking in Persian/Farsi and Globish/English
</li><li class="li-itemize">Dict via Emacs is used for dictionary and thesarus lookup in multiple languages
</li><li class="li-itemize">Conversion from LaTeX to html is accomplished through HeVea and tex4ht
</li><li class="li-itemize">Libre Office is used for creating figures and illustrations
</li><li class="li-itemize">Git via magit of Emacs is used for version control
</li><li class="li-itemize">Emacs Gnus and qmail facilities are used for emailing out drafts and receiving feedback
</li><li class="li-itemize">Integration with ByStar Services is through BLEE (the ByStar Libre Emacs Environment)
</li></ul><p>These Libre-Halaal software tools collectively represent a deeply integrated environment that is
far superior in capability to any Haraam software. We question why so many people continue
to use the clumsy and ineffective Microsoft Proprietary-Haraam software when such a vastly superior
alternative is available.</p>
