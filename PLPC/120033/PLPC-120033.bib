That which exists in nature in multiples, we call poly-existentials.
Information and knowledge exist in nature in multiples – not in singular.
Information and knowledge are poly-existentials.
In this document we analyze the topic of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
from a new perspective. The topic of restriction of poly-existentials and
Western IPR are one and the same. Yet, the concept of poly-existentials has not
appeared in prior discussions of this topic. This is the very first time that
the concept and the word “poly-existetials” are being introduced.
The concept of poly-existence makes the fraudulence of Western IPR clear and
obvious.
Beyond rejecting Western IPR and calling for its abolishment we introduce the
\"Libre-Halaal\" label for the halaal manner-of-existence of poly-existentials.
Based on that, we then provide definitional criteria for Libre-Halaal_Software
and Libre-Halaal_Internet_Services.
Towards a cure, as a a moral alterantive to the proprietary american digital
ecosystem we put forward the The_Libre-Halaal_ByStar_Digital_Ecosystem.
Equipped with our blueprint and our initial implementation of the ByStar
digital ecosystem we then turn our attention to economics and business. We
introduce the model of Global_Poly-Existential_Capitalism and based on that
bring forward Neda’s_Open_Business_Plan_for_ByStar.
Our main goal for all of this has been to influence societal policies towards
adoption of halaal manner-of-existence of poly-existentials in Eastern
societies in general and Iran in particular. The last chapter of this document
focuses on the model of Libre-Halaal poly-existentials as a replacement for the
Western IPR regime.",
